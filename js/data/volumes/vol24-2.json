    "abstract": "Abstract Implantation is a complex process by which the embryo attaches to the endometrium. The human endometrium becomes receptive to the embryo during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle under the influence of steroid hormones and paracrine factors originating from endometrial cells and the embryo. Several paracrine factors influencing the implantation include leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin (IL)-11. Moreover, timely development of pinopodes, and expression of integrins and Hox genes in endometrium, and oocyte quality also determines the implantation outcome. Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disorder and estimated that 25 to 50% of infertile women have endometriosis. Although the mechanisms contributing to infertility are poorly understood, accumulating evidence suggests that altered folliculogenesis, sperm dysfunction, impaired fertilization, toxicity against early embryonic development, defective implantation, and poor oocyte quality with decreased ability to implant may be the contributing factors in some endometriosis patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Effects of propofol and etomidate induction on hemodynamic and endocrine stress response in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were investigated in this study. Patients and Methods: After the approval of the local ethics committee was obtained, forty, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status II-III patients undergoing scheduled coronary artery bypass surgery were enrolled in the study. Patients were allocated randomly to receive either propofol or etomidate for anesthesia induction. Anesthesia was maintained in both groups with 1% isoflurane, 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen. Results: Hemodynamically, Group E was more stable than Group P following induction of anesthesia (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of glucose response. There was a significant difference in Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels between the groups in control and t4 measurements (p<0.05). In group P, levels of blood cortisol significantly decreased after induction (p<0.05) but increased with Cardio Pulmonary By-pass (CPB). In group E, significant decrements ase in cortisol levels continued also during CPB, (p<0.05). Conclusion: Etomidate may be preferred to propofol for the induction of anesthesia in CABG because of its hemodynamic stability. Etomidate inhibited cortisol secretion temporarily and this inhibition may be useful to prevent stress response due to CABG surgery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: We evaluated the results of rheumatic mitral valve replacement with preservation of subvalvular apparatus. Patients and Methods: Mitral valve replacement, isolated or in combination with other procedures, was performed in 36 patients (31 females, 5 males; mean age 37.7±14 years; range 14 to 66 years) between January 1996 and 2000. Mitral insufficiency alone or in combination with mitral stenosis was present in 44.4% and 50%, respectively. Concomitant procedures were performed in 44% for associated cardiac lesions. Subvalvular apparatus was preserved in all patients by different techniques. Posterior leaflet was retained in 27 patients, anterior leaflet was retained in one patient, both anterior and posterior leaflets were retained in eight patients. The follow-up period ranged between 13 to 16 months. Results: NYHA classification score was 2.61±0.54 preoperatively and 1.63±0.76 postoperatively (p<0.05). Left ventricular end diastolic diameter and left atrial diameter decreased at the end of the postoperative first year. Mortality, valvular thrombosis, or left ventricular outflow obstruction were not observed during the follow-up period. Conclusion: Some reconstructive techniques can be performed in patients with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis and regurgitation. However, a second operation, usually mitral valve replacement, is required after some period in most of these patients.This condition brings an additional economical burden and an operational risk to the patient, as well. Therefore, whenever repair techniques are not sufficient due to advanced disease, we recommend mitral valve replacement with preservation of subvalvular apparatus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Inguinal hernia is the most common surgical disorder in childhood and is associated with 5-18 % incarceration risk. The clinical features of incarcerated inguinal hernia in infants and children were assessed. Patients and Methods: The medical records of 33 pediatric cases (30 males, 3 females; mean age 2 years; range 20 days-6 years) treated and followed up in our hospital for incarcerated inguinal hernia in the period of January 1994 and June 2006 were retrospectivelye evaluated. Results: The most frequent symptoms were inguinal lump (n=33), vomiting (n=19) and crepitation of the scrotum (n=10). Manual reduction of hernia was successful in 26 cases and 7 of them underwent emergency hernia repair. Small bowel was the most frequent incarcerated organ (n=22). Testicular ischemia developed in 3 patients, partial small bowel ischemia in 2, and colon ischemia in one patient. Two patients (6%) died due to incarcerated inguinal hernia. Conclusion: We think that in our region, cases of incarcerated inguinal hernia are admitted to the hospital with delay. The children with inguinal hernia should be operated as soon as possible.

    "abstract": "Abstract Regional techniques are preferred to general anesthesia in lowerextremity surgery. Especially in elderly patients with high cardiac risk, the main objective is to supply sufficient anesthesia preserving hemodynamic stability. A 63-year-old female patient in whom emergency right leg amputation above the knee was planned, was treated for myocardial infarction without ST elevation 6 days ago. She had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 15 years, and hypertension for 10 years. She underwent a coronary bypass operation for two vessels and mitral annuloplasty two years ago and right leg amputation below the knee two months ago. An intrathecal cathater was placed at the right lateral position from L3-4 intervertebral space through the cathater by the needle technique. After cerebrospinal fluid flow was observed, we administered 2,5 mg 0.5% bupivacaine. Anesthesia was maintained by performing 2.5 mg of bupivacain every five minutes at a total dose of 7.5 mg until adequate sensory block was reached. The patient was given a supine positione after the sensory block reached T10 level. The patient was hemodynamically stable during the operation and did not require additional drug from the catheter. The patient was sent to the ward after removing spinal cathater at the end of a one hour operation. In conclusion, especially in old patients with high cardiac risk, we think that continuous spinal anesthesia should be the method of choice for anesthesia in lower-extremity surgery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Anatomical dimensions of lateral ulnar collateral and annular ligaments were determined in the present study. Patients and Methods: These measurements were performed on 20 elbows from 10 cadavers. Lateral ulnar collateral and annular ligaments were dissected in all elbows and their anatomical lengths and widths were measured. Results: The mean length of the right annular ligament was 55.6 mm and the mean width was 12.6 mm. The mean length of the right lateral ulnar collateral ligament was 23.2 mm and the mean width was 13.6 mm. The mean length of the left annular ligament was 55.4 mm and the mean width was 11.5 mm. The mean length of the left lateral ulnar collateral ligament was 19.3 mm and the mean width was 12.1 mm. Conclusion: Ruptures of lateral ulnar collateral and annular ligaments generally occur during elbow dislocations. The dimensions of these two ligaments are important since they determine the grafts to be chosen for their surgical repair. These dimensions are quite helpful for the surgeon who will perform the reconstruction for estimating the length and thickness of the graft to be used for this purpose. When the mean values obtained in the present study are taken into consideration, grafts of at least 10 cm in length, a value which is five folds greater than the ligaments' lenght, are required for repairing the lateral ulnar collateral and annular ligaments. We believe that more reliable results can be obtained with series comprising higher numbers of cadavers.",
