    "abstract": "Background: As the idea of stem cell technology in the treatment of sensorial hearing loss has emerged over the past decades, the need for in vivo models for related experiments has become explicit. One of the most common experimental models for inner ear stem cell delivery experiments is the Wistar albino rat. Aims: To investigate the surgical anatomy of the temporal bone of the Wistar albino rat with respect to the dissection steps, operative techniques and potential pitfalls of surgery. Study Design: Animal experimentation. Methods: Adult Wistar albino rats were operated on via the retroauricular approach under an operation microscope. The anatomy of the temporal bone, the surgical route to the temporal bulla and the inner ear were investigated. Technical details of surgical steps, complications and potential pitfalls during the surgery were noted. Results: The study group consisted of 40 adult Wistar albino rats. The mean times to reach the bulla and to achieve cochleostomy were 4.3 (2-13 min) and 7.5 min (3.5-22 min), respectively. The mean width of the facial nerve was 0.84 mm (0.42-1.25 mm). The stapedial artery lay nearly perpendicular to the course of the facial nerve (88-93 °C). There were three major complications: two large cochleostomies and one massive bleed from the stapedial artery. Conclusion: The facial nerve was the key anatomical landmark in locating the bulla. By retrograde tracing of the facial nerve, it was possible to find the bulla ventral (inferior) to the main trunk. The facial nerve trunk was the upper limit when drilling the bulla. By dissecting the main trunk of the facial nerve and retracting cranially, a large drilling space could be achieved. Our results suggest that the retroauricular approach is an effective, feasible route for inner ear drug delivery experiments in Wistar albino rats.",

    "abstract": "Background: Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations are recommended in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients to decrease associated risks at all stages. Although the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is high in our country, as previously reported, vaccination rates are low. Aims: To assess the vaccination rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients and factors that may affect these. Study Design: Multi-centre cross-sectional study. Methods: Patients admitted to the chest diseases clinics of six different centres between 1 February 2013 and 1 January 2014 with a pre-diagnosis of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease according to the Global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease criteria, who were in a stable condition were included in the study. The survey, which included demographic characteristics, socio-economic status, severity of disease and vaccination information, was first tested on a small patient population before the study. The survey was completed by the investigators after obtaining written informed consent. Results: The average age of the 296 included patients was 66.3±9.3 years and 91.9% were male. Of these, 36.5% had the influenza vaccination and 14.1% had the pneumococcal vaccination. The most common reason for not being vaccinated was ‘no recommendation by doctors’: 57.2% in the case of influenza vaccinations, and 46.8% in the case of pneumococcal vaccinations. Both vaccination rates were significantly higher in those patients with comorbidities (influenza vaccination p<0.001; pneumococcal vaccination p=0.06). There was no significant correlation with age, gender, smoking and severity of disease (p>0.05). Vaccination rates were significantly higher in those with a white-collar occupation and higher education level, and who presented to a university hospital (p<0.001). Conclusion: Medical professionals do not request vaccinations as often as the International Guidelines suggest for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Awareness of the importance of these vaccinations among both doctors and patients needs to be addressed.",

Novel techniques such as transpulmonary hypothermia with cooled oxygen inhalation may be beneficial. Aims: To evaluate the performance of transthoracic hypothermia with cooled medical oxygen inhalation as a therapeutic hypothermia method. Study Design: Animal experimentation. Methods: A total of 36 adult male Wistar-Hannover rats were used in this research. Rats were randomised into four groups: group 1, Cooled oxygen group; group 2, IV cold fluid group; group 3, Surface cooling group; group 4, control group. No hypothermia method was applied in the control group. Hypothermia techniques were administered in the other three groups until the targeted core temperature was maintained. The target temperature was continued for one hour at 32-34 °C. After that, rats were heated up with hot blankets. Once the rectal temperature reached 38 °C, rats were euthanised. The main outcomes were the rate of temperature decrease (°C per minute) (S) and the time required to reach the target body temperature (T). Results: All rats survived the study protocol. When compared to the control group, T and S values were better in the cooled medical oxygen inhalation group (p<0.001). The IV cold fluid group had lower S values and higher T values compared to the cooled oxygen group (p<0.001, and p=0.003, respectively). There was no meaningful pathology in the histological samples in any group. Conclusion: As an easy-to-use and inexpensive method, cooled oxygen inhalation may be a beneficial hypothermia technique.",

    "previewText": "Background: Therapeutic hypothermia was showed to improve neurologic outcome but current therapeutic hypothermia techniques have limitations. Novel techniques such as transpulmonary hypothermia with cooled oxygen inhalation may be beneficial. Aims: To evaluate the performance of transthoracic hypothermia with cooled medical oxygen inhalation as a therapeutic hypothermia method. Study Design: Animal experimentation. Methods: A total of 36 adult male Wistar-Hannover rats were used in this research. Rats were randomised into four groups: group 1, Cooled oxygen group; group 2, IV cold fluid group; group 3, Surface cooling group; group 4, control group.

A complex interaction of both genetic and environmental factors is thought to contribute to the disease. Aims: To evaluate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TLR2 gene c.2258C>T (R753Q) (rs5743708) and TLR2 c.-148+1614T>A (A-16934T) (rs4696480) (NM_0032643) are associated with atopic dermatitis in Turkish children. Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: The study was conducted on 70 Turkish children with atopic dermatitis aged 0.5-18 years. The clinical severity of atopic dermatitis was evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. Serum total IgE levels, specific IgE antibodies to inhalant and food allergens were measured in both atopic dermatitis patients and controls, skin prick tests were done on 70 children with atopic dermatitis. Genotyping for TLR2 (R753Q and A-16934T) single nucleotide polymorphisms was performed in both atopic dermatitis patients and controls. Results: Cytosine-cytosine and cytosin-thymine genotype frequencies of the TLR2 R753Q single nucleotide polymorphism in the atopic dermatitis group were determined as being 98.6% and 1.4%, cytosine allele frequency for TLR2 R753Q single nucleotide polymorphism was determined as 99.29% and the thymine allele frequency was 0.71%, thymine-thymine, thymine-adenine, and adenine-adenine genotype frequencies of the TLR2 A-16934T single nucleotide polymorphism were 24.3%, 44.3%, and 31.4%. The thymine allele frequency for the TLR2 A-16934T single nucleotide polymorphism in the atopic dermatitis group was 46.43%, and the adenine allele frequency was 53.57%, respectively. There was not statistically significant difference between the groups for all investigated polymorphisms (p>0.05). For all single nucleotide polymorphisms studied, allelic distribution was analogous among atopic dermatitis patients and controls, and no significant statistical difference was observed. No homozygous carriers of the TLR2 R753Q single nucleotide polymorphism were found in the atopic dermatitis and control groups.

    "abstract": "Background: Autologous nerve grafts are used to bridge peripheral nerve defects. Limited sources and donor site morbidity are the major problems with peripheral nerve grafts. Although various types of autologous grafts such as arteries, veins and muscles have been recommended, an ideal conduit has not yet been described. Aims: To investigate the effectiveness of a small intestinal conduit for peripheral nerve defects. Study Design: Animal experimentation. Methods: Twenty-one rats were divided into three groups (n=7). Following anaesthesia, sciatic nerve exploration was performed in the Sham group. The 10 mm nerve gap was bridged with a 15 mm ileal segment in the small intestinal conduit group and the defect was replaced with orthotopic nerve in autologous nerve graft group. The functional recovery was tested monthly by walking-track analysis and the sciatic functional index. Histological evaluation was performed on the 12th week. Results: Sciatic functional index tests are better in autologous nerve graft group (-55.09±6.35); however, during follow-up, progress in sciatic functional index was demonstrated, along with axonal regeneration and innervation of target muscles in the small intestinal conduit group (-76.36±12.08) (p<0.05). In histologic sections, distinctive sciatic nerve regeneration was examined in the small intestinal conduit group. The expression of S-100 and neurofilament was observed in small intestinal conduit group but was less organised than in the autologous nerve graft group. Although the counted number (7459.79±1833.50 vs. 4226.51±1063.06 mm2), measured diameter [2.19 (2.15-2.88) vs. 1.74 (1.50-2.09) µm] and myelin sheath thickness [1.18 (1.09-1.44) vs. 0.66 (0.40-1.07) µm] of axons is significantly high in the middle sections of autologous nerve graft compared to the small intestinal conduit group, respectively (p<0.05), the peripheral nerve regeneration was also observed in the small intestinal conduit group. Conclusion: Small intestinal conduit should not be considered as an alternative to autologous nerve grafts in its current form; however, the results are promising. Even though the results are no better than autologous nerve grafts, with additional procedures, it might be a good alternative due to harvesting abundant sources without donor site morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Background: Mucosal melanoma is a rare malignancy arising from melanocytes of the mucosal surfaces. The pattern and frequency of oncogenic mutations and histopathological biomarkers have a role on distinct tumour behaviour and survival. Aims: To assess the rate of C-KIT positivity and its effect on survival of surgically treated sinonasal malignant melanoma patients with other histopathological biomarkers and clinical features. Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: Seventeen sinonasal malignant melanoma patients with a mean age of 65.41 (39-86) years were included.

The impact of age, gender, stage and extent of the disease, type of surgery, and adjuvant therapies were also taken into consideration. The effect of mitotic index, pigmentation, S100, HMB-45, Melan-A and C-KIT on survival were evaluated. Results: Median tumour size was 20 mm (interquartile range=27.5 mm). Pigmentation was present in 7 (41.2%) cases. Median number of mitoses per millimetre squared was 11 (interquartile range=13). Melan A was positive in 7 (41.2%) patients, ulceration was present in 6 cases (35.3%), and necrosis was present in (47.1%) 8 cases.

Five year overall and disease free survival rates were 61.4% and 43.8%, respectively. Conclusion: Although C-KIT positive sinonasal malignant melanoma patients (52.9%) can be candidates for targeted tumour therapies, the studied clinical or histopathological features along with C-KIT seem to have no significant effect on survival in a small group of patients with sinonasal malignant melanoma.",

Aims: To investigate the effects of occupational arsenic exposure on the lung by high-resolution computed tomography and pulmonary function tests. Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: In this study, 256 workers with suspected respiratory occupational arsenic exposure were included, with an average age of 32.9±7.8 years and an average of 3.5±2.7 working years. Hair and urinary arsenic levels were analysed. High-resolution computed tomography and pulmonary function tests were done. Results: In workers with occupational arsenic exposure, high-resolution computed tomography showed 18.8% pulmonary involvement. In pulmonary involvement, pulmonary nodule was the most frequently seen lesion (64.5%). The other findings of pulmonary involvement were 18.8% diffuse interstitial lung disease, 12.5% bronchiectasis, and 27.1% bullae-emphysema. The mean age of patients with pulmonary involvement was higher and as they smoked more. The pulmonary involvement was 5.2 times higher in patients with skin lesions because of arsenic.

    "abstract": "Aims: To investigate the changes in mRNA expression levels of telomerase-related significant proteins in several types of cancer. Methods: Human telomerase reverse transcriptase, pontin, reptin and dyskerin expressions were measured in normal and tumour tissues obtained from 26 patients with colorectal, breast and gastric cancers, using the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. Results: For all patients, no significant difference was found in mRNA expressions of human telomerase reverse transcriptase and dyskerin (p>0.05), although their levels in tumour tissues were found to be higher than in normal tissues. However, pontin and reptin mRNA expressions were significantly higher in tumour tissues than in normal tissues (p<0.01). While human telomerase reverse transcriptase showed a high correlation with only pontin (p<0.001) in normal tissues, high positive correlations were observed between human telomerase reverse transcriptase with pontin (p<0.005), reptin (p<0.01) and dyskerin (p<0.01) in tumour tissues. Conclusion: The increased mRNA expressions of all four genes in tumour tissues may suggest a role in cancer development. Correlations of pontin, reptin and dyskerin with human telomerase reverse transcriptase support the hypotheses describing their roles in telomerase complexes.",

Pulmonary hydatid cyst-induced embolization is a rare complication of heart or liver hydatid cysts. Case Report: We describe the fatal case of a 15-year-old boy without any known prior illness who was admitted to the hospital after feeling unwell and dropping to the ground while playing ball. During the autopsy, a lesional mass, with dimensions of 13x6 cm, was observed in the left lobe of the liver. The histomorphological examination of pulmonary sections showed scolices observed in pulmonary vessel lumina, thus a non-thrombosis hydatid embolism was diagnosed.
