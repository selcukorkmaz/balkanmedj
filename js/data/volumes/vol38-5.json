    "abstract": "Background: There is limited research into the utility of average volume- assured pressure support (AVAPS), a volume-assured pressure-controlled mode, especially in patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure.Aims: This study aimed at a randomized comparison of AVAPS and bilevel positive airway pressure spontaneous/timed (BPAP S/T) modes in non-invasive mechanical ventilation application with hypercapnic respiratory failure patients in the emergency department.Study Design: Randomized controlled study.Methods: Eighty of 140 patients admitted to the emergency department with hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring non-invasive mechanical ventilation were randomly assigned to the AVAPS or S/T groups (33 patients in the S/T group, 47 patients in the AVAPS group) using the sealed envelope method. Data of arterial blood gas, vital parameters, Glasgow Coma Score, additional treatment needs, and clinical outcomes were evaluated, and the treatment success rates of both groups were compared.Results: A total of 80 patients, 33 in the S/T and 47 in the AVAPS group, were analyzed in the study. The pH values improved in the AVAPS group compared to the baseline (0.07 [0.04-0.10] vs 0.03 [0.00-0.11]). PaCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) excretion was faster in the AVAPS group than in the S/T group in the first hour (10.20 mmHg [6.20-19.20] vs. 4.75 ([-] 0.83-16.88)). The comparison of blood gas measurements showed no significant differences between the groups regarding the changes in PaCO2 and pH values over time (P = .141 and P = .271, respectively). During the emergency department follow-up, 3 (6.4%) patients in the AVAPS group and 5 (15.2%) patients in the S/T group needed intubation [Relative risk: 0.42 (95% CI: 0.11 to 1.64), P = .21].Conclusion: The AVAPS mode is as effective and safe as BPAP S/T in treating patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure in the emergency department.",

However, genetic testing is crucial for diagnosis.Aims: To investigate the 7 MODY-related genes and clinical findings of patients with a preliminary clinical diagnosis of MODY.Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.Methods: In this study, 7 genes (KCNJ11, ABCC8, INS, GCK, HNF4A, HNF1A, and HNF1B) related to MODY were screened via targeted sequencing in 182 cases with a confirmed pre-diagnosis of MODY. The clinical characteristics of the patients were evaluated retrospectively.Results: A total of 182 patients, 48% of whom were women, between the ages of 18-62 were included in the study. In 30 cases (16.4%), 28 different pathogenic variations were found, of which 20 were previously reported and 8 were novel variations segregated by disease within the family. Pathogenic variations were detected in the following genes in order of mutation frequency; GCK, HNF1A, ABCC8, HNF4A, HNF1B and KCNJ11. Interestingly, six of the 30 cases (20%) carried a pathogenic variation in the ABCC8 gene. No mutation was detected in the INS gene. A family history of vertically transmitted diabetes and elevated HbA1C at the time of diagnosis were found in 20 (66%) and 16 (52%) cases, respectively.Conclusion: In this series, 28 different pathogenic variations are identified, 8 of which are novel.

Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) may be useful in enhancing the efficacy of radiotherapy, such as radiosensitization, in cancer therapy.Aims: To develop a nanodrug complex containing cetuximab (C225,CTX) and cisplatin (CDDP) conjugated with GNPs and to investigate its cytotoxic effects on oral cavity cancer cells when combined with radiotherapy.Study Design: In vitro cell culture study.Methods: The GNPs were synthesized and successfully conjugated with cetuximab and cisplatin. Cell viability was monitored by the xCELLigence real-time cell analysis (RTCA) single-plate (SP) system in GNP-treated UPCI-SCC-131 cells for 48 hours. Cells with/without GNPs were irradiated with 6 MV X-rays, and colony formation was assayed to investigate the long-term effects of GNPs and the nanodrug complex after irradiation on radiotherapy-resistant oral cavity cancer cells.Results: The GNPs entered the tumor cells, and GNP–CDDP (P <.0001) and GNP–CDDP–CTX (P < .0001) were shown to cause a decrease in cell viability. GNP and GNP–CTX combined with radiotherapy led to greater reduction on UPCI-SCC-131 colony numbers, than radiation alone (P = .0369) and radiation with free CTX, with sensitizing enhancement ratios of 1 : 2 and 1 : 9, respectively.Conclusion: The cetuximab and cisplatin-conjugated gold nanodrug complex has a great potential to increase cytotoxicity and overcome resistance to radiotherapy, in the treatment of oral cavity cancer.",

    "abstract": "Background: There are limited data on the long-term outcomes of COVID-19 from different parts of the world.Aims: To determine risk factors of 90-day mortality in critically ill patients in Turkish intensive care units (ICUs), with respiratory failure.Study design: Retrospective, observational cohort.Methods: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and who had been followed up in the ICUs with respiratory failure for more than 24 hours were included in the study. Their demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory variables, treatment protocols, and survival data were recorded.Results: A total of 421 patients were included. The median age was 67 (IQR: 57-76) years, and 251 patients (59.6%) were men. The 90-day mortality rate was 55.1%.

    "abstract": "Background: Rho/ROCK signaling has been demonstrated to be involved in the vascular reactivity of many arterial networks. However, RhoA expression and the contribution of Rho/ROCK pathway to the control of perfusion pressure have not been investigated in the rat hind limb vascular bed as a skeletal muscle vascular network.Aims: To investigate the contribution of the Rho/ROCK pathway in the control of perfusion pressure in the isolated-perfused rat hind limb vascular bed.Study Design: Animal experimentation.Methods: Two Rho inhibitors (atorvastatin and C3 exoenzyme) and ROCK inhibitors (Y-27632 and fasudil) were tested on the phenylephrine-elevated perfusion pressure in the isolated-perfused rat hind limb vascular bed. Furthermore, we sought the expression of RhoA protein in the femoral, popliteal and saphenous arteries as well as quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles by Western blotting.Results: The ROCK inhibitors Y-27632 and fasudil (both 10−8 to 10−5 M) induced substantial vasodilatations. The maximum vasodilatations induced by Y-27632 and fasudil (both at 10−5 M) were 84.0 ± 6.9% and 76.9 ± 6.9%, respectively (P = .091). Y-27632 was not more potent than fasudil, as the EC50 values for Y-27632 and fasudil were 0.7 ± 2.1 μM and 2.5 ± 2.4 μM, respectively (P = .177). Atorvastatin (10−7 to 10−4 M) and C3 exoenzyme (3 × 10−8 M) also produced vasodilatation (maximum vasodilatation; 20.3 ± 1.7% and 13.7 ± 3.6%, respectively). The EC50 value for atorvastatin was 94.9 ± 1.2 μM.

BCR is defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value of 2.0 ng/mL greater than the absolute nadir. All of the individuals had a diagnosis of prostate cancer via biopsy after proton beam therapy, with negative findings on magnetic resonance imaging/computer tomography of the pelvis and abdomen, and a bone scan. The sRARP procedure with pelvic lymph node dissection was performed by a single surgeon in all patients.Results: The median age of the cohort at sRARP was 66.8 years, and the mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m2. The mean duration from proton beam therapy to sRARP was 58.4 months; the mean preoperative PSA level was 5.5 ng/mL, the mean operative time was 230 minutes, and the approximate blood loss was 745 mL. Anastomotic leakage occurred in half of the individuals, and bladder neck contracture developed in 6 patients. For 8 patients, the continence results within 6 months followup were available.
