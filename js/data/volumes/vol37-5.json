    "abstract": "Abstract Autoinflammatory diseases are characterized by recurrent fevers and clinical findings of impaired natural immunity and can involve various organ systems. The concept of autoinflammatory disease emerged after the definition of familial Mediterranean fever and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome. This new disease group was considered to differ from the standard concept of autoimmune diseases, which is relatively better known in terms of basic features, such as defects in innate immunity and the absence of antibodies. A better understanding has been achieved regarding the genetic and pathogenetic mechanisms of this relatively new disease group over the past 20 years since they were first diagnosed, which have led to some changes in the concept of autoinflammatory diseases. The recent definition classifies autoinflammatory disease to be a wide range of diseases with different clinical features, mainly accompanied by changes in innate immune and rarely in humoral immunity. The spectrum of autoinflammatory diseases is rapidly expanding owing to recent developments in molecular sciences and genetics. This review article discusses the clinical features, classification criteria, treatment options, and long-term prognosis of periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis syndrome, and other common autoinflammatory diseases in the light of current literature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: One of the most important techniques of cardiac magnetic resonance in assessment of coronary heart diseases is adenosine stress myocardial first-pass perfusion imaging. Using this imaging method, there should be an adequate response to the drug adenosine to make an accurate evaluation. The conventional signs of drug response are not always observed and are often subjective. Methods based on splenic perfusion might possess limitations as well. Therefore, T1 mapping presents as a novel, quantitative and reliable method. There are several studies analyzing this newly discovered property of different T1 mapping sequences. However most of these studies are enrolling only one of the techniques.Aims: To compare modified look-locker inversion recovery and shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery sequences in terms of T1 reactivity and to determine the relationship between T1 reactivity and conventional stress adequacy assessment methods in adenosine stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance.Study Design: A cross-sectional study using STARD reporting guideline.Methods: Thirty-four consecutive patients, who were referred for adenosine stress perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance with suspect of myocardial ischemia, were prospectively enrolled into the study. Four patients were disqualified, and thirty patients were included in the final analysis. Using both modified look-locker inversion recovery and shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery, midventricular short axis slices of T1 maps were acquired at rest and during peak adenosine stress before gadolinium administration. Then, they were divided into six segments according to the 17-segment model proposed by the American Heart Association, and separate measurements were made from each segment. Mean rest and mean stress T1 values of remote, ischemic, and infarcted myocardium were calculated individually per subject. During adenosine administration, patients’ heart rates and blood pressures are measured and recorded every one minute. Adenosine stress perfusion images were examined for the presence of splenic switch-off.Results: There was a significant difference between rest and stress T1 values of remote myocardium in both modified look-locker inversion recovery and shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery (p<0.001). In both modified look-locker inversion recovery and shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery there was no significant correlation between T1 reactivity and heart rates response (modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.30, shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.10), blood pressures response (modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.062, shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.078), splenic perfusion (modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.35, shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.053). There was no statistically significant difference between modified look-locker inversion recovery and shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery regarding T1 reactivity of remote (p=0.330), ischemic (p=0.068), and infarcted (p=0.116) myocardium.Conclusion: T1 reactivity is independent of the other stress response signs and modified look-locker inversion recovery and shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery do not differ in terms of T1 reactivity.",

In both modified look-locker inversion recovery and shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery there was no significant correlation between T1 reactivity and heart rates response (modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.30, shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.10), blood pressures response (modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.062, shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.078), splenic perfusion (modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.35, shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery p=0.053). There was no statistically significant difference between modified look-locker inversion recovery and shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery regarding T1 reactivity of remote (p=0.330), ischemic (p=0.068), and infarcted (p=0.116) myocardium.Conclusion: T1 reactivity is independent of the other stress response signs and modified look-locker inversion recovery and shortened modified look-locker inversion recovery do not differ in terms of T1 reactivity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Bypass graft surgery remains to be an important treatment option for left main and multivessel coronary artery disease. Approximately 2% of saphenous vein grafts are lost immediately after the coronary artery bypass graft operations and 12% in the first month due to thrombosis.Aims: To administer one anticoagulant and two antiplatelet agents in a way that locally affects the vein graft before the bypass operation and to thereby analyse their effects on early graft thrombosis.Study Design: Animal experimentation.Methods: Since ticagrelor was used locally for the first time in this study, its efficacy in combination with other drugs (acetylsalicylic acid, acetylsalicylic acid and ticagrelor, and acetylsalicylic acid + ticagrelor + unfractionated heparin) was examined on rats including control (untreated) and sham (pluronic gel) group (n=14 for each group). Before the tunica adventitia layer of the femoral veins was bypassed to the femoral artery, it was coated with the drug-eluting pluronic F-127 gel. The presence or absence of thrombus in the vein graft samples was recorded under light microscopy. In vein graft preparations where thrombus was detected, the thrombus area (µm2) was calculated using the Axiovision software. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with the anti-rat von Willebrand factor polyclonal antibody kit.Results: The number of preparations containing thrombus was significantly lower in the acetylsalicylic acid + ticagrelor + unfractionated heparin group than in the acetylsalicylic acid, control, and sham groups, according to the comparisons made on the 1st and 3rd days (p=0.001 and 0.02, respectively). von Willebrand factor staining was significantly lower in the acetylsalicylic acid + ticagrelor + unfractionated heparin group than in the other groups on the 3rd day (p=0.005).Conclusion: Locally effective acetylsalicylic acid-ticagrelor-unfractionated heparin complex has been shown to significantly reduce thrombus formation in vein grafts in this experimental model. Local administration of these drugs, which are routinely administered orally just before stent implantations, on the vein graft before the bypass is performed can prevent the loss of vein grafts due to thrombus, thereby reducing the mortality and morbidity of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims: Juxtaglomerular cell tumor is a rare kidney tumor. This study aimed to report the clinic features of juxtaglomerular cell tumor and our treatment experience.Methods: The medical records of 9 juxtaglomerular cell tumor patients treated in our hospital from 1997 to 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical characteristics, immunohistochemical findings, treatments and outcomes were collected.Results: The mean age of 9 patients was 24±8.1 years (range: 18-37). All cases had symptoms of hypertension, hyperaldosteronism, high plasma renin, high plasma angiotensin II. Four cases had hypokalemia. The renal masses were found by enhanced contrast tomography in all patients. One case received ultrasound-guided ablation and was clinically diagnosed with juxtaglomerular cell tumor. Among the remaining 8 cases, 2 cases received nephrectomy while 6 underwent partial nephrectomy. The 8 cases were pathologically diagnosed with juxtaglomerular cell tumor. Immunohistochemical findings showed that juxtaglomerular cell tumor was positive for vimentin, CD34, and actin but negative for chromogranin A. After treatment, all the patients had normal levels of blood pressure, serum renin activity, potassium, and aldosterone. No patients had tumor progress or metastasis within a median follow-up period of 94 (range: 33-241) months.Conclusion: Hypertension combined with hyperaldosteronism and hypokalemia secondary to high plasma renin activity are the typical symptoms of juxtaglomerular cell tumor. Partial nephrectomy is an optimal treatment for juxtaglomerular cell tumor.",
