    "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex, chronic, and progressive neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by irreversible dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra. Alpha-synuclein is normally a synaptic protein that plays a key role in PD due to pathological accumulation as oligomers or fibrils. Clustered alpha-synuclein binds to the Toll-like receptors and activates the microglia, which initiates a process that continues with pro-inflammatory cytokine production and secretion. Pro-inflammatory cytokine overproduction and secretion induce cell death and accelerate PD progression. Microglia are found in a resting state in physiological conditions. Microglia became activated by stimulating Toll-like receptors on it under pathological conditions, such as alpha-synuclein aggregation, environmental toxins, or oxidative stress. The interaction between Toll-like receptors and its downstream pathway triggers an activation series, leads to nuclear factor-kappa B activation, initiates the inflammasome formation, and increases cytokine levels. This consecutive inflammatory process leads to dopaminergic cell damage and cell death. Microglia become overactive in response to chronic inflammation, which is observed in PD and causes excessive cytotoxic factor production, such as reactive oxidase, nitric oxide, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. This inflammatory process contributes to the exacerbation of pathology by triggering neuronal damage or death. Current treatments, such as dopaminergic agonists, anticholinergics, or monoamine oxidase inhibitors alleviate PD symptoms, but they can not stop the disease progression. Finding a radical treatment option or stopping the progression is essential when considering that PD is the second most reported neurodegenerative disorder. Many cytokines are released during inflammation, and they can start the phagocytic process, which caused the degradation of infected cells along with healthy ones. Therefore, targeting the pathological mechanisms, such as microglial activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, that should be involved in the treatment program is important. Neuroinflammation is one of the key factors involved in PD pathogenesis as well as alpha-synuclein accumulation, synaptic dysfunction, or dopaminergic neuronal loss, especially in the substantia nigra. Therefore, evaluating the therapeutic efficiency of the mechanisms is important, such as microglial activation and nuclear factor-kappa B pathway or inflammasome formation inhibition, and cytokine release interruption against neuroinflammation may create new treatment possibilities for PD. This study examined the pathological relation between PD and neuroinflammation, and targeting neuroinflammation as an opportunity for PD treatments, such as Toll-like receptor antagonists, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing-3 inflammasome inhibitors, cytokine inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonists, reactive oxygen species inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",

The secondary outcomes were the hemodynamics and laboratory variables, postoperative complications, length of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit and hospital stay.Study Design: A randomized controlled studyMethods: Sixty patients were scheduled and randomized into two groups of 30 patients each: in the study group, an arterial pressure catheter was inserted and connected to the FloTrac system, whereas in the control group, an arterial pressure catheter was inserted and integrated into the hemodynamic monitoring system with a special transducer. The control group had fluids administered at the discretion of the anesthesiologist according to the mean arterial pressure >65 mmHg and diuresis >0.5 ml/kg/h. In the study group, fluid management was administered to achieve a target value of ≤13% through the stroke volume variation.Results: The total amounts of fluid in the intraoperative period were different between the groups, with the study group receiving significantly more fluids (P = 0.0455). The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the study group than in the control group (P = 0.012), but prolonged oxygen demand was significantly more frequent in the control group than in the study group (P = 0.017).

Pediatric pulmonary embolism has many unknown characteristics.Aims: To evaluate clinical features, genetic and acquired risk factors, diagnostic imaging, and treatment strategies with long-term results in children with pulmonary embolism.Study Design: A retrospective multicenter clinical trialMethods: Patients aged 0-18 years who were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) findings (intraluminal filling defect in the lobar or main pulmonary artery) in 3 university hospitals between 2006 and 2021 were included in the study. A form was created for data standardization, and variables were collected retrospectively through medical record review. In addition to the features given above, we also evaluated in situ pulmonary artery thrombosis (ISPAT) and patients’ Wells scores. Follow-up CTPA results were evaluated for patient response to treatment. Complete recovery means that there were no lesions, incomplete recovery if there was still embolism, and no response if there was no change.Results: Twenty-four patients (female:13, male:11) were included in the study. The mean age was 13.5 years. All patients but one had at least one or more genetic or acquired risk factors. Factor V Leiden mutation (16.6%) was the most common genetic risk factor. Six of 16 patients with Doppler ultrasonography were diagnosed with ISPAT because there was no sign of thromboembolic thrombosis. Nine (41.6%) patients had a Wells score of >4 (pulmonary embolism clinically strong), and 15 (58.4%) patients scored <4 (pulmonary embolism clinically likely weak), indicating that an alternative diagnosis was more likely than pulmonary embolism (sensitivity %37.5). The mean follow-up period was 23 (±17) months. Complete and incomplete recovery was observed in 15 (62.5%) and 7 (29.1%) patients, respectively, among the patients who underwent follow-up evaluation.
