All Sprague−Dawley rats were killed at 7 weeks after unilateral nostril obstruction modeling. Then, structural changes in bone tissues were detected by micro-computed tomography, and the expression levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB, osteoprotegerin, and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand in the signal pathway of bone metabolism within the local alveolar bone and serum of rats were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting.Results: The results showed that receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB levels in bone tissues and serum in the oral breathing group were higher than those in the control group [Maxillary alveolar bone: receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (pRNA=0.009, pprotein=0.008), receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (pRNA=0.008, pprotein=0.009); Mandibular alveolar bone: receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (pRNA=0.047, pprotein=0.042), receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (pRNA=0.041, pprotein=0.007); Serum: receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (pRNA<0.001, pprotein<0.001), receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (pRNA<0.001, pprotein<0.001)], along with decreased osteoprotegerin expression (Maxillary alveolar bone: pRNA=0.038, pprotein=0.048; Mandibular alveolar bone: pRNA<0.001, pprotein<0.001; Serum: pRNA=0.009, pprotein=0.006) and elevated receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand/osteoprotegerin.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Idiopathic premature ventricular contractions are frequently detected ventricular arrhythmias, and radiofrequency ablation is an effectively treatment for improving symptoms and eliminating premature ventricular contractions. Studies have reported a relationship between an elevated epicardial adipose tissue thickness and myocardial structural pathologies. However, the association between epicardial adipose tissue thickness and success rates of premature ventricular contraction ablation has not yet been investigated.Aims: To assess the relationship between epicardial adipose tissue thickness and success rates of premature ventricular contraction ablation.Study Design: Retrospective case-control study.Methods: This study enrolled a total of 106 consecutive patients who have had a high premature ventricular contraction burden of >10,000/24-h assessed using ambulatory Holter monitorization and underwent catheter ablation. A frequency of premature ventricular contractions of more than 10,000/day was defined as frequent premature ventricular contraction. Epicardial adipose tissue thickness was measured using 2D transthoracic echocardiography. A successful ablation was defined as >80% decrease in pre-procedural premature ventricular contraction attacks with the same morphology during 24-h Holter monitorization after a 1-month follow-up visit from an ablation procedure.Results: Successful premature ventricular contraction ablation was achieved in 87 (82.1%) patients. Epicardial adipose tissue thickness was significantly higher in patients with unsuccessful ablation (p<0.001). Procedure time, total fluoroscopy time, and radiofrequency ablation time were statistically higher in the unsuccessful group (p<0.001). Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that epicardial adipose tissue thickness and pseudo-delta wave time were independently associated with procedural success (both p values <0.001). In the receiver-operating curve analysis, epicardial adipose tissue thickness was found to be an important predictor for procedural success (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve= 0.85, p=0.001), with a cutoff value of 7.7 mm, a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 68%.Conclusion: Epicardial adipose tissue thickness is higher in patients with premature ventricular contraction ablation failure, which may be indicative of procedural success.",

Serum levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1/chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 were detected by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assays. The existence of tender points was evaluated based on the standardized manual tender point examination. Pressure pain thresholds at the knees, and bilateral trapezius muscles were measured with an algometer. A visual analog scale and the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire were utilized to assess the degree of pain and functional abilities. Results: Serum levels of monocyte chemotactic protein-1/chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 were significantly greater in patients with fibromyalgia compared with healthy controls (151.6±31.9 pg/mL vs 103.3±25.2 pg/mL, p<0.001). Patients with severe fibromyalgia had significantly higher serum levels of chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 than patients with mild and moderate fibromyalgia (173.1±21.9 pg/mL vs 151.0.0±35.1 pg/mL, p=0.01). Patients with moderate fibromyalgia revealed markedly augmented serum levels of chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 compared with patients with mild fibromyalgia (151.0±35.1 pg/mL vs 133.3±23.9 pg/mL, p=0.03). Serum levels of chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 were positively associated with tender point scores (r=0.455, p<0.001). In addition, serum levels of chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 were positively associated with pressure pain thresholds in both knees and bilateral trapezius muscles (knees: r=-0.349, p=0.002; trapezius muscles: r=-0.318, p=0.004).

The tumors were classified according to their predominant component (lepidic, acinar, papillary, solid, micropapillary, and mucinous), and their predictive values were assessed for clinicopathologic characteristics and overall survival.Results: The patient cohort comprised 158 (32.2%) patients with solid predominant, 150 (30.5%) with acinar predominant, 80 (16.3%) with papillary predominant, 75 (15.3%) with lepidic predominant, 22 (4.5%) with mucinous, and 5 (1.0%) with micropapillary subtype, and 1 (0.2%) with adenocarcinoma in situ. Overall 5-year survival of 491 patients was found to be 51.8%. Patients with lepidic, acinar, and mucinous adenocarcinoma had 70.9%, 59.0%, and 66.6% 5-year survival, respectively, and there was no statistically significant difference between them.

Compared to other histologic subtypes, patients with solid and papillary predominant adenocarcinoma had significantly lower survival than those with lepidic (p<0.001, p=0.002), acinar (p<0.001, p=0.008), and mucinous (p=0.048, p=0.048) subtypes, respectively.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims: Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to a deficiency of the α-galactosidase A enzyme. Cardiac involvement is present in over 60% of adult cases of Fabry disease. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is the most common phenotype. The aim of the study was to screen adult patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without left ventricular outflow tract.Methods: A total of 80 patients between the ages of 18 and 65 years old, were referred to a tertiary center for trans-thoracic echocardiography for various clinical indications. They were investigated for the presence of idiopathic left ventricular hypertrophy without resting or dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Plasma α-galactosidase A enzyme activity and α-galactosidase GLA gene mutations were investigated.Results: The mean age was 41.5±12.7 years and 66.25% of patients were males. The mean echocardiographic parameters were as follows: left ventricular ejection fraction 60.7±7.4%, interventricular septum thickness 18.2±4.4 mm, left ventricular posterior wall 13.5±2.1 mm, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter 47.4±6.2 mm, left ventricular end-systolic diameter 27.8±6.5 mm, and left ventricular mass index 171.05±48.5 g/m². Hemizygous mutations associated with Fabry disease were detected in two male patients (2.50% of the screened population): NM_000169.2:c.334C>T(p.Arg112Cys), NM_000169.2:c.902G>A(p.Arg301Gln).Conclusion: Fabry disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis in a highly selected patient population with unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy. The cardiologist may play an important role in the screening and diagnosis of the disease.",
