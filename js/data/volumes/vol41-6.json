    "abstract": "Genome editing technologies have demonstrated significant potential for treating diseases caused by various molecular changes. These include cancer, cystic fibrosis, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, heart diseases, and rare genetic disorders.1,2 Genome editing technologies also offer potential solutions for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease and neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The leading genome editing technologies are zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activatorlike effector nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9). Among these technologies, CRISPR/Cas9 is the most widely used due to its versatility, effectiveness, efficiency, and ease of application.3 This groundbreaking genome manipulation tool is revolutionizing scientific research, medical diagnostics, and therapeutic applications. Major advancements in editing efficacy have propelled genome editing strategies to phase 3 human clinical trials. However, the CRISPR technology is associated with some challenges such as high costs, ineffective delivery methods for specific targets, and poor efficiency of the genome editing processes, particularly due to offtarget effects.3,4 The CRISPR-Cas9 system employs a single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence and the Cas9 endonuclease. The sgRNA is formed by combining the CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA), which subsequently directs the sgRNA/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex to a specific DNA sequence. Once the target DNA is identified, Cas9 induces double-stranded breaks at the target site. These breaks can be repaired via insertions, deletions, additions or inversions. The DNA repair process can either rely on the cell’s natural repair mechanisms or utilize custom-designed DNA sequences.2 However, the system can be inefficient and imprecise, often resulting in small insertions or deletions, as well as unintended large deletions and complex rearrangements.5 Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly being used across all areas of science and technology. The integration of AI with genome editing systems offers unparalleled precision and efficiency, which could potentially revolutionize the treatment of mutational diseases and oncology.6 AI-based machine and deep learning tools have been employed to design sgRNAs for the CRISPR-Cas systems.7 Off-target effects are primarily influenced by sgRNAs. Thus, the sgRNAs should be carefully designed to maximize the efficiency of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology.2,8 Tools such as DeepCRISPR, CRISTA, and DeepHF can predict the most effective sgRNAs for a given target sequence.3 These methods use algorithms that are based on the globally reported growing gene-editing datasets, and they help predict CRISPR sgRNA activity and specificity scores.9,10 AI models design and optimize genome editing techniques, which helps predict editing efficiency, specificity, and outcomes. The deep learning algorithm, which uses endogenous factors and sequence information from genomic datasets, can accurately predict base editing outcomes. It serves as a computational tool for selecting optimal sgRNAs for base editing applications.11 For example, AI can help select the best editing method (base, prime, or epigenome) for specific target sequences by considering genomic context and potential off-target effects. Furthermore, it can optimize the distribution and expression of editing components such as Cas proteins, sgRNAs, and epigenetic modifiers.3 AI can solve complex problems beyond human capability and is applicable in the screening, early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction of critical diseases such as cancer.12,13 Precision oncology, a tailored approach to cancer treatment, relies on detailed tumor information, including biomarkers, to inform treatment decisions. This method frequently necessitates the analysis of vast datasets using advanced computational techniques. AI can accurately identify genomic profile mutations from multiple clones in heterogeneous tumor biopsies. This capability is essential because detecting cancer stem cells, which are linked to treatment resistance and recurrence, could significantly improve therapeutic strategies.14,15 Therefore, AI could play a significant role in targeting these specific cells. Moreover, AI models can provide a quantitative framework for examining the relationship between network features and cancer, enabling the identification of potential anticancer targets and the discovery of new drug candidates. Despite its potential, there are still numerous challenges to overcome when applying AI to mutational diseases. These challenges include ensuring data privacy, obtaining diverse and representative datasets, and reducing algorithmic bias. Therefore, the ethical, reliable, and effective application of AI tools in healthcare requires collaboration among technologists, clinicians, and policymakers. The ongoing evolution of technology, particularly the integration of AI with genome editing, could transform genetics, biomedicine, and healthcare. This could offer new opportunities for significant advancements in human health through enhanced data analysis and tailored treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: A high density of stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) is positively correlated with the pathological complete response rate and favorable survival in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Heterogeneity in stromal lymphocyte distribution and limited tumor sampling may affect the accuracy of sTIL quantification in biopsy samples from patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy. Thus, identifying additional biomarkers to complement sTIL evaluation is essential.Aims: To identify biomarkers that could be used to complement sTILs evaluation.Study Design: Retrospective cohort study.Methods: A total of 162 patients with invasive TNBC were enrolled in the study. The following data were gathered: sTIL density, Ki67, nuclear grades of cancer cells, lymphovascular invasion status, the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, axillary lymph node metastasis status, and ultrasonographic parameters of the tumor (size, shape, orientation, margin, internal echo pattern, posterior feature, and vascularity). The relationship between sTIL density and ultrasonographic or clinicopathological characteristics was investigated using both continuous and categorical analyses.Results: Posterior features of the primary tumors was associated with sTIL density (p = 0.038). Additionally, the Ki67 levels and nuclear grades were also associated with sTIL density (p < 0.001 and p = 0.024, respectively). When stratified according to a 20% cut-off of sTIL density, the posterior features of primary tumors, Ki67 levels, and nuclear grades significantly differed between the high and low sTIL density tumors. Tumors with high Ki67 levels were more likely to exhibit high sTIL density than low sTIL density [odds ratio (OR): 2.75, p = 0.021]. Furthermore, nuclear grade III tumors demonstrated significantly higher sTIL density than nuclear grade I-II tumors (OR: 2.49, p = 0.014). Additionally, tumors with posterior enhancement or no posterior features were more likely to exhibit high sTIL density than tumors with acoustic shadows (OR: 2.91, p = 0.028; OR: 2.74, p = 0.022, respectively).Conclusion: Low sTIL density is frequently observed in tumors exhibiting acoustic shadows on ultrasound. However, high sTIL density is more common in tumors with posterior enhancement or no posterior features. Furthermore, high Ki67 levels (> 40%) and high nuclear grades are positively correlated with high sTIL density.

The vehicle, or KP-54 (3 nmol/kg, applied topically to the rhinarium), was administered daily for a seven-day period. The sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and open field test (OFT) were implemented to evaluate depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, respectively, seven days following the lesion surgery. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in the amygdala were quantified using mass spectrometry. Tyrosine hydroxylase in substantia nigra was analyzed using immunohistochemistry.Results: The nasal delivery of KP-54 significantly reduced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors that were induced by 6-OHDA, as indicated by the results of the SPT, OFT, and EPMT. Moreover, it was observed that nasal KP-54 effectively mitigated 6-OHDA-induced motor deficits and the loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. The nasal administration of KP-54 augmented the decline in GABA levels in the amygdala induced by 6-OHDA. Furthermore, effective correlations were established between GABA concentrations and behavioral parameters.Conclusion: The nasal delivery of KP-54 could function as a viable therapeutic alternative for treating mood-related disorders in PD.",

Alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression in hemi-Parkinsonian rats.Study Design: Experimental study.Methods: This study included adult Sprague Dawley male rats who were administered either a vehicle (artificial cerebrospinal fluid) or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilaterally into the medial forebrain bundle. The vehicle, or KP-54 (3 nmol/kg, applied topically to the rhinarium), was administered daily for a seven-day period. The sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and open field test (OFT) were implemented to evaluate depression- and anxiety-like behaviors, respectively, seven days following the lesion surgery. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations in the amygdala were quantified using mass spectrometry. Tyrosine hydroxylase in substantia nigra was analyzed using immunohistochemistry.Results: The nasal delivery of KP-54 significantly reduced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors that were induced by 6-OHDA, as indicated by the results of the SPT, OFT, and EPMT.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Endometriosis (EM) is an inflammatory condition in which the endometrium is observed to develop outside the uterine cavity. Endometrium has conventionally been recognized as a rich source of endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (E-MSCs). The influence of dienogest, a medication frequently prescribed for EM, on E-MSCs has not been extensively investigated.Aims: To explore effects of dienogest on the E-MSCs derived from healthy (E-MSCs-control) and diseased (E-MSCs-endometriosis) endometrial tissue samples in vitro.Study Design: In vitro study.Methods: We collected samples from healthy and diseased endometrial tissues. E-MSCs were derived from both healthy and EM tissues. The effect of dienogest (VISANNE) on E-MSCs was assessed by examining cell proliferation, telomerase activity, cell migration, and estrogen secretion levels after the isolation and characterization of E-MSCs.Results: We discovered that cellular proliferation rate was higher in the E-MSCs derived from EM tissues compared to those derived from healthy tissue. The proliferation rate and telomerase activity were both suppressed by dienogest treatment, particularly in E-MSCs-endometriosis. The drug treatment also resulted in a decrease in the migration capacity of E-MSCs-endometriosis, from 60.4% to 59.2%. The expression of CXCL12, Ki67, and beta-catenin was analyzed in both E-MSCs-endometriosis and E-MSCs-control. The CXCL12 and Ki67 expressions were quite elevated in the E-MSCs-endometriosis without drug treatment compared to the E-MSCs-control. Following the treatment, these levels declined drastically to the levels close to E-MSCs-control. Similarly, this decrease in gene expression was accompanied by a decrease in estrogen secretion into the medium.Conclusion: This research demonstrates that dienogest exerts a substantial impact on both stromal and stem cells, as it effectively controls the disease by reversing EM markers, despite the absence of progesterone receptors on endometrial stem cells.",
