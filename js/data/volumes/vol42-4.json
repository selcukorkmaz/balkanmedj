    "abstract": "Abstract Multiple myeloma (MM) treatment becomes a major challenge once triple-class or penta-refractoriness develops. Emerging immunotherapies, including bispecific antibodies or chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, are promising options for such patients. However, the requirement for specialized expertise and staff under stringent manufacturing conditions results in high costs and restricted production. This article explores the manufacturing and clinical application of CAR T-cells in MM, highlighting their potential, limitations, and strategies to enhance efficacy. CAR-T can be manufactured by pharmaceutical companies or accredited academic centers authorized to produce and market gene-edited cellular products. This process includes sequential steps: T cell apheresis from the patient, selection of the cells, activation, gene transfer, expansion of the produced cells, cryopreservation, and reinfusion of the cells into a lymphodepleted patient. While CD3+ T cells are typically employed for CAR-T production in clinical studies, studies have demonstrated the potential advantages of specific T cell subgroups, such as naive, central memory, and memory stem cells, in enhancing efficacy. Following T cell harvesting, the subsequent phase involves genetic modification. CAR-T cells are frequently produced by applying viral vectors such as g-retrovirus or lentivirus. Although viral vectors are commonly used, non-viral methods-including CRISPR/Cas9 and integrative mRNA transfection methods produced by transposons-are also employed. Five different CAR-T cell generations have been developed. The myeloma-specific targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), signaling lymphocyte activation molecular family 7, and G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member D are the most extensively studied in clinical trials. Emerging CAR-T cell targets under investigation include CD138, CD19, kappa light chain, CD56, NY-ESO-1, CD70, TACI, and natural killer G2D. In 2021, idecabtagene vicleucel, a BCMA-targeting agent, became the first CAR-T therapy approved for relapsed/refractory MM, marking a significant milestone in MM treatment. Subsequently, ciltacabtagene autoleucel has also been approved. However, CAR-T resistance is an emerging issue. Resistance mechanisms include T cell exhaustion, antigen escape (loss of BCMA), and tumor microenvironment-related inhibitors. To address these challenges, strategies such as BCMA non-targeted or dual-targeted CAR-T, memory T cells, humanized CAR-T, and rapidly manufactured PHE885 cells have been developed. To enhance specificity, ongoing investigations include bicistronic CAR/co-stimulator receptors, formation of memory-phenotype T cells, combination with immunomodulators or checkpoint inhibitors, armored CAR-T cells, cancer-associated fibroblast inhibitors, and CAR approaches that inhibit exhaustion signals. In conclusion, studies are exploring the use of CAR-T at an earlier stage, including at diagnosis, with an aim to replace ASCT. CAR-T has introduced a new dimension to MM treatment; however, limited efficacy in high-risk MM and the emergence of resistance to CAR-T remain key challenges to be addressed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Lattice radiotherapy (LRT) is a novel spatially fractionated radiotherapy technique specifically designed to treat large tumors more effectively. By alternating high-dose and low-dose regions within the tumor, LRT generates a highly diverse dose distribution. Aims: To review recent literature on LRT to determine its therapeutic efficacy, survival outcomes, and adverse event rates in treating large-volume tumors, thereby strengthening the evidence base for clinical application. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of all relevant LRT studies identified in four databases-PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science-from their inception to September 2024. Only full-text articles were considered eligible. This study adhered to the 2020 PRISMA guidelines. Results: The meta-analysis included seven single-arm studies comprising 187 patients. The pooled 3-month complete response rate and partial response rate were 36.67% and 42.49%, respectively, while the three-month progressive disease rate was 7.10%. The tumor volume was reduced by 48.95%. According to survival analysis, the pooled 6-month overall survival rate was 79.27%, with a median response time of 4.25 months. The pooled rates of mild and moderate-to-severe adverse events were 19.40% and 3.37%, respectively. LRT has demonstrated high local control rates and a favorable safety profile in managing large-volume tumors.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Given the growing incidence of pleural effusions and the limited availability of medical thoracoscopy (MT) in clinical practice, ultrasound (US)-guided pleural needle biopsies using Abrams or cutting needles are increasingly being used for the histopathological diagnosis of pleural diseases. Aims: To assessed the diagnostic yield and safety of US-guided Abrams and cutting needles to determine the optimal needle type for specific clinical situations. Study Design: Prospective randomized study. Methods: The study included 174 patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion requiring histopathological evaluation. Patients were randomized into two arms: those who underwent US-guided cutting needle biopsy (US-CNPB) and those who underwent US-guided Abrams needle biopsy (US-ANPB). Results: The US-CNPB group exhibited a false-negative rate of 36.9% and diagnostic accuracy of 63.0%. compared to 21.3% and 78.7% in the US-ANPB group, with significant differences between the groups (p = 0.036 and 0.045, respectively). In patients with pleural thickening < 1 cm or absent on US, US-CNPB exhibited 55.2% diagnostic accuracy and a negative likelihood ratio (-LR) of 0.57. For US-ANPB, the corresponding rates were 77.3% and 0.32. The difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two groups was significant (p = 0.009). In patients with pleural thickening ≥ 1 cm, the diagnostic accuracy of US-CNPB was 93.3% and 88.9% for US-ANPB, with no significant difference between the groups. The corresponding -LR values were 0.08 and 0.17. In patients with pleural thickening < 1 cm, four major bleeding events (6.9%) occurred in the US-CNPB group. No deaths were reported in this study. Conclusion: US-CNPB should be preferred in patients with pleural thickness ≥ 1 cm on US. MT is recommended for patients with pleural thickening < 1 cm or those presenting with pleural effusion without pleural thickening. However, in the absence of MT, US-ANPB is the preferred alternative because of its superior diagnostic accuracy and procedural safety.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The accumulation of proteins such as amyloid-beta and tau, which disrupt normal cellular processes, characterizes Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Cognitive decline is strongly linked to tau pathology, which initially manifests in the medial temporal lobe (MTL). Aims: To investigated the association between cognitive performance and regional tau accumulation, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, in cognitively normal older adults. Understanding this relationship is critical for early intervention before noticeable cognitive decline emerges. Study Design: Retrospective study. Methods: Tau PET scans were conducted on 440 participants enrolled in the anti-amyloid treatment in asymptomatic Alzheimer’s (A4) study. The participants, aged 65-85, were cognitively unimpaired and had complete demographic and genetic profiles. Tau levels in the MTL and temporal neocortex (NEO) was quantified using composite metrics. Cognitive function was evaluated using the preclinical Alzheimer’s cognitive composite (PACC) and its individual components. Multiple linear regression models were applied to determine the associations between tau burden and cognitive outcomes, including interaction terms to evaluate the moderating roles of sex and apolipoprotein E (APOE)-ε4 genotype. Results: The average participant age was 71.8 years (standard deviation = 4.84), with females comprising 58% of the sample. Greater tau accumulation in both tauMTL and tauNEO regions was significantly associated with lower cognitive scores. Specifically, reduced PACC scores (p < 0.001) corresponded with higher tau levels in both regions, primarily influenced by declines in Delayed Logical Memory and Free and Cued Selective Reminding test scores. Additionally, tauNEO levels were modestly linked to Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The effects of sex and APOE-ε4 status were minimal. Conclusion: Elevated tau deposition in the MTL and NEO is associated with diminished cognitive function, particularly in memory and processing speed domains. Notably, tau accumulation in the MTL showed a strong association with poorer outcomes on memory-related cognitive measures. The limited influence of sex and APOE-ε4 genotype highlights tau pathology as a key contributor to early cognitive decline in preclinical AD.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: MRP8/14, a calcium-binding protein of the S100 family, is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells and exhibits proinflammatory and prothrombotic properties. Platelet-neutrophil interactions can trigger MRP8/14 release, but their role in atherosclerosis (AS) remains unclear. Aims: To investigate the effect of MRP8/14 on AS progression and the underlying mechanisms involved, focusing on neutrophil activation and the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-ERK1/2-p90RSK and NRF2-ARE pathways. Study Design: Ex vivo and animal study. Methods: Neutrophils isolated from mouse bone marrow were stimulated with P-selectin to induce MRP8/14 release, which was subsequently quantified using ELISA. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) formation was induced by phobolol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and Mrp8/14 expression was examined via fluorescence labeling. Cytokine release and CD11b expression were assessed using flow cytometry. An AS mouse model was established by administering a high-fat diet. Atherosclerotic plaque size was analyzed using Oil Red O staining. Proteins from the TLR4-ERK1/2-p90RSK and NRF2-ARE pathways were analyzed by Western blotting. Results: P-selectin induced MRP8/14 release, which was inhibited by P-selectin antagonists. NET formation also contributed to MRP8/14 secretion. hMRP8/14 treatment enhanced CD11b expression, neutrophil adhesion, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. In AS mice, MRP8/14 secretion was linked to TLR4 upregulation, ERK1/2-p90RSK signaling activation, and NRF2-ARE pathway inhibition. Paquinimod, an MRP8/14 antagonist, mitigated neutrophil activation, inflammation, and arterial plaque formation.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The association between the glucose-to-lymphocyte ratio (GLR) and adverse outcomes in intensive care unit patients receiving mechanical ventilation (MV) has not been clearly established. Aims: To examine the link between GLR and 28-day mortality in MV patients and to develop an interpretable machine learning model to predict mortality risk. Study Design: A retrospective study. Methods: Data were obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 3.1) database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves were employed to assess the relationship between GLR and mortality. Patients were categorized into high and low GLR groups for Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the association across different patient populations. Selected variables were used to construct eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine, Naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors models. Model interpretability was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. Results: A total of 5,738 patients met the inclusion criteria. RCS analysis indicated a nonlinear relationship between GLR and 28-day mortality. Patients with elevated GLR had significantly higher 28-day mortality rates (hazard ratio > 1, p < 0.05). Among the models, XGBoost demonstrated the best performance, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.969 and an F1-score of 0.963. SHAP analysis identified Acute Physiology Score III, GLR, and lactate as the three most important predictors. Conclusion: GLR is nonlinearly associated with 28-day mortality in patients undergoing MV and may serve as a valuable prognostic marker. The interpretable XGBoost model confirmed the significant association between GLR and short-term mortality.",
