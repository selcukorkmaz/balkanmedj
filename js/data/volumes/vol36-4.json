    "abstract": "Coronary symptoms associated with conditions related to mast cell activation and inflammatory cell interactions, such as those involving T-lymphocytes and macrophages, further inducing allergic, hypersensitivity, anaphylactic, or anaphylactic insults, are currently referred to as the Kounis syndrome. Kounis syndrome is caused by inflammatory mediators released during allergic insults, post-inflammatory cell activation, and interactions via multidirectional stimuli. A platelet subset of 20% with high- and low-affinity IgE surface receptors is also involved in this process. Kounis syndrome is not just a single-organ but also a complex multisystem and multi-organ arterial clinical condition; it affects the coronary, mesenteric, and cerebral arteries and is accompanied by allergy–hypersensitivity–anaphylaxis involving the skin, respiratory, and vascular systems in the context of anesthesia, surgery, radiology, oncology, or even dental and psychiatric medicine; further, it has significantly influences both morbidity and mortality. Kounis syndrome might be caused by numerous and continuously increasing causes, with broad clinical symptoms and signs, via multi-organ arterial system involvement, in patients of any age, thereby demonstrating predominant anaphylactic features in terms of a wide spectrum of mast cell-association disorders. Cardiac symptoms, such as chest pain, coronary vasospasm, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, acute cardiac failure, and sudden cardiac death associated with subclinical, clinical, acute, or chronic allergic reactions, constitute the clinical manifestations of this syndrome. Since its first description, a common pathway between allergic and non-allergic coronary events has been demonstrated. The hypothesis is based on the existence of a much higher degree of mast cell degranulation at plaque erosion or rupture sites compared with at the adjacent areas or even more distant segments in post-acute myocardial infarction of non-allergic etiology. Although mast cell activation, differentiation, and mediator release takes days or weeks, the mast cell degranulation may occur just before any acute coronary event, further resulting in coronary artery vasoconstriction and atheromatous plaque rupture. It seems that medications and natural molecules stabilizing the mast cell membrane as well as monoclonal antibodies protecting the mast cell surface can emerge as novel therapeutic modalities for acute coronary and cerebrovascular event prevention.",

We also evaluated whether these genetic features have prognostic significance.Study Design: Diagnostic accuracy study.Methods: Between the years 2011 and 2016, 60 gliomas were examined.

The 1p/19q status and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α/CEP4 amplification were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization. After molecular tests, if the diagnosis of oligodendroglioma or astrocytoma is not diagnosed, case should be diagnosed as oligoastrocytoma.

There is no specific or sensitive test for the diagnosis of oligoastrocytoma. However, 1p/19q codeletion was spesific (100%) and sensitive (100%) for oligodendroglioma. ATRX and p53 mutation showed high spesificity (100% and 95.1% respectively) for diagnosing astrocytoma. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α/ CEP4 was not detected in any of the cases. There was association between isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation and 1p/19q loss with longer survival (respectively p=0.147 and p=0.178).Conclusion: In grade 2 and grade 3 glial tumors, pathological diagnosis is not possible only by histological examination. Overall, there was a diagnosis change in 28 cases (46.6%). Especially in cases of oligoastrocytoma, the diagnosis is changed by molecular tests.",

However, few articles have targeted at the role of nuclear factor-kB inhibitor in heart failure.Aims: To evaluate the effects of nuclear factor-kB inhibitor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate on cardiocyte apoptosis and cardiac function in a rat heart failure model.Study Design: Animal experiment.Methods: A stable and reproducible rat heart failure model (n=64) was prepared by injecting homologous microthrombotic particles into the left ventricle of Sprague–Dawley rats while obstructing the ascending aorta to produce coronary microembolization. Rats with heart failure were randomized into untreated (HFu) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate-treated (HFp) groups; the latter received an intraperitoneal injection of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (100 mg/kg/day) 1 h prior to surgery as well as on postoperative days 1-7. The sham group comprised 32 Sprague–Dawley rats. Eight rats from each group were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 postoperatively. Masson’s trichrome staining was used to determine the micro-fibrotic area to indicate the severity of myocardial loss. Terminal transferase uridine triphosphate nick end labeling staining was used to detect apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Echocardiography and hemodynamics were performed to evaluate left ventricular function.Results: Rats with heart failure exhibited pathological changes evidenced by patchy myocardial fibrosis, remarkably elevated severity of myocardial loss, and persistently reduced left ventricular function. At the end of the study, compared with the HFu group, myocardial infarct size was reduced by 28% (p=0.001), cardiocyte apoptosis was suppressed (7.17%±1.47% vs 2.83%±0.75%, p<0.001), cardiac function parameters such as left ventricular ejection fraction (80%±4% vs 61%±6%), left ventricular + dP/dt max (4828±289 vs 2918±76 mmHg.s−1), left ventricular - dP/dt max (4398±269 vs 2481±365 mmHg.s−1), and left ventricular systolic pressure (126±13 vs 100±10 mmHg) were significantly increased, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was reduced (18±2 vs 13±1 mmHg) (p<0.001, for all) in the HFu group.Conclusion: Our rat model can adequately mimic heart failure via coronary vessel embolization. Moreover, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate treatment can reduce cardiocyte apoptosis and improve cardiac function, which may be beneficial for patients with heart failure secondary to myocardial infarction.",
