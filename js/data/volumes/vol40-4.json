    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder, characterized by multiple café-au-lait macules, axillary and inguinal freckling, tumors of the nervous system, and iris hamartomas. More than 3,100 different pathogenic variants have been reported in the NF1 gene, including missense, nonsense, frameshift, in-frame, splicing, and large deletions.Aims: To determine the NF1 mutational spectrum in patients with NF1 from the Republic of North Macedonia.Study Design: A cohort study.Methods: Molecular analyses included reverse transcription and cDNA sequencing of the NF1 gene and next-generation sequencing using the TruSight Cancer panel, along with the multiple ligation probe amplification method to detect single nucleotide variants and copy number variations. Direct DNA sequencing was also used for the family member analysis.Results: Our 9-year study of patients suspected of having NF1 in the Republic of North Macedonia encompassed molecular characterization of 30 cases of the disease. We identified 28 unique pathogenic NF1 variants (NM_001042492.3), of which ten were novel: c.208delA; c.341_364del; c.1480_1481delTT; c.2325+1G>C; c.2495_2496dupAC; c.2533_2541del; c.4517delC; c.5844C>G; c.6971delA; c.7605_7606delGAinsAT. In addition to the variant spectrum analysis, our research revealed two positive genotype-phenotype correlations. One between the clinical manifestation of cognitive impairment and gross deletions in the NF1 gene, and the other between cognitive impairment and truncating variants located in the RAS-GAP functional domain.Conclusion: This is the first study of NF1 patients in the Republic of North Macedonia, and it contributes ten novel variants to the global spectrum of pathogenic NF1 variants. It also corroborates the crucial importance of NF1 genetic testing for a prompt and precise diagnosis, particularly in younger patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic has contributed to work-related psychosocial risks in healthcare workers.Aims: To evaluate the perceived need for mental health services and related factors in Turkish healthcare workers practicing in pandemic hospitals.Study Design: Cross-sectional study.Methods: Data were collected from face-to-face interviews with healthcare workers at 19 pandemic hospitals in 13 provinces between September and November 2021. The study survey included the evaluation of the perceived need for and utilization of mental health services in the previous year, as well as sociodemographic, health-related, and work-related characteristics, the General Health Questionnaire-12, the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF) questionnaire, and the Fear of coronavirus disease-2019 scale (FCV-19S).Results: Of 1,556 participants, 522 (33.5%) reported a perceived need for mental health services, but only 133 (8.5%) reported receiving these services. Multiple logistic regression analysis of the perceived need for mental health services revealed significant relationships with lower age, female sex, being a current smoker, having a chronic disease, having a mental disorder, coronavirus disease-2019 contact within the last three months in settings other than the home or workplace, a positive coronavirus disease-2019 vaccination history, being a physician, being a non-physician healthcare professional, and coronavirus disease-2019 contact within the last three months at work. After adjustment for these characteristics, higher General Health Questionnaire-12 and FCV-19S scores and lower WHOQoL-BREF domain scores were related to the perceived need for mental health services in logistic regression analyses.Conclusion: The findings indicate a substantial need for mental health services amongst Turkish healthcare workers during the pandemic and outline participants’ characteristics regarding high-priority groups for the intervention.

The model adequacy of the fitted growth curves was evaluated with the worm plot. The fit of the BMI model to the data was found to be sufficient, with 95% of the BMI values occurring between two elliptic curves.Conclusion: The study shows a slight increase in BMI percentile values obtained by gender compared to WHO standards.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Hemoglobinopathies are the most common inherited diseases in humans resulting from impaired globin chain synthesis of hemoglobin. The progression of thalassemia rates is prevented with prenatal screening methods.Aims: To evaluate the hematological parameters of α- and β-thalassemia and normal fetuses aged 17-25 weeks of gestation.Study Design: A cross-sectional study.Methods: Pregnant women who underwent cordocentesis in the second trimester because of the risk of having a baby with thalassemia were included in the study. Hematological indices and molecular DNA methods were analyzed from the cord blood samples of 129 women who were 17-25 weeks into pregnancy. The HPLC method was used for Hb fraction analysis. Amplification refractory mutation system, restriction enzyme analysis, multiplex polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing methods were used for the molecular analysis. Maternal contamination was eliminated by the short tandem repeat method.Results: In total, 112 of the fetuses carry α- and β-thalassemia heterozygous or homozygous (α: 37, β: 58, mixed: 17) and 17 fetuses had a normal genotype for thalassemia. Significant differences in adult hemoglobin (HbA), fetal hemoglobin (HbF), Hb Barts, MCV, MCH, and RDW were detected in three groups compared with the normal group (p < 0.001, except for RBC, Hb, HCT, and MCHC). Differences in HbF, Hb Barts, MCV, MCH, and RDW were observed in the α-thalassemia groups compared with the normal group (p < 0.001). Among the five β-thalassemia subgroups, only HbA and RDW were different from the normal group (p < 0.001).Conclusion: This study could be a good reference for future studies and prenatal diagnostic applications in emphasizing the importance of changes in the blood parameters of fetuses before molecular genotyping. These hematological data give valuable information to clinicians about the fetus to enlighten families in making appropriate decisions during prenatal diagnosis.",

Thirty-four patients received RTX combined with TAC (RTX + TAC group), and 57 patients were treated with RTX alone (RTX group).
