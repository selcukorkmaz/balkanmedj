    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) contributes to morbidity and mortality in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Aims: The aim of the present study is to assess the influence of HBV co-infection in clinical characteristics and disease evolution among nosocomial HIV infected youth in Romania. Study Design: Retrospective study. Methods: We assessed HBsAg in 179 young people with nosocomial paediatric HIV infection. Demographic data, ALAT level, CD4-count, HIV-RNA, antiretroviral therapy and clinical behaviour were all statistically compared in patients who were HIV mono-infected and HBV-co-infected. Results: The characteristics of patients are as follows: sex ratio M/F: 55.3%, AIDS category 88%, median nadir CD4-count 126/mm3. The prevalence of persistent HBsAg was 44.6%. The mortality rate was 11.1%, but no correlation with HBsAg was found. An average of three antiretroviral combinations is experienced by 97.7% of patients, including Lamivudine for over 5 years in 76% of cases and Tenofovir/Emtricitabine in 16.75% of patients. Patients under antiretroviral therapy achieved 53.07% sustained undetectable HIV-RNA and 40.78% restored immunity CD4-count >500/mm3. ALAT enzyme was found to be high in 54.75% of patients. Conclusion: During our research, we noticed that HBsAg was elevated in young people with HIV in Romania. Mortality rate was not statistically correlated to HBsAg. High ALAT levels are related with HBV, HDV co-infections, virological failure to antiretroviral treatment and the risk of death.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Excessive apoptosis is believed to play a role in many degenerative and non-degenerative neurological diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Much recent data suggest that apoptotic mechanisms may represent the missing link between Aβ deposition and proteolysis of tau protein. However, there is emerging evidence that apoptotic mechanisms may play a role in Alzheimer’s Disease pathogenesis in the absence of overt apoptosis. TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor 1 (Death Receptor 4, DR4) might impair the apoptotic signal transduction and lead to dysregulation of the homeostasis between cell survival and cell death. Aims: The aim of our study was to further investigate the relationship between genetic variants of DR4 and Alzheimer’s Disease. Study Design: Case control study. Methods: Sixty-eight patients with AD were included in the study. The control group comprised 72 subjects without signs of neurodegenerative diseases, as evidenced by the examination.DNA was extracted from whole blood using the salting-out procedure. Genotypes were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP) products. Results: We observed significant differences in the genotypic distribution of the rs6557634 polymorphism in AD patients compared with controls (p<0.05); our data suggest that the GA genotype in rs6557634 could be protective against AD (p<0.05). However, there were no significant differences between AD patients and control groups in terms of the DR4 rs20575 polymorphism (p>0.05) and the DR4 rs20576 polymorphism (p>0.05). According to haplotype analysis of the DR4 gene for rs6557634, rs20575 and rs20576 polymorphisms, GCA and GCC haplotypes might be a risk factor for AD. Also, we have shown that ACA, GGC and GGA haplotypes might be protective factors against AD. Conclusion: The present results indicate for the first time the possible contribution of the DR4 gene rs6557634, rs20575, rs20576 polymorphisms in Alzheimer’s Disease, which may influence susceptibility to Alzheimer’s Disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The most commonly observed pathology in chest traumas is rib fracture, and the most important clinical symptom is severe pain. Aims: To investigate the effectiveness of intramuscular opioid (IMO), intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IVPCA) and the Fentanyl transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) in the management of rib fracture pain. Study Design: Prospective randomized clinical trial. Methods: In our prospective and randomised study, we included 45 patients with a diagnosis of multiple rib fractures. There were three groups and intercostal nerve blockage (ICB) in the first day and oral paracetamol for five days was administered to each group as standard. In Group IMO (n=15), 4x40 mg pethidine HCl was administered to the patients, while in Group IVPCA (n=15) this was 5 µg/mL continuous intravenous fentanyl and was 50 µg fentanyl TTS in Group TTS (n=15). The demographics, injury data and vital signs of the patients were recorded. Pain was scored using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The pain during lying down (VASl) and mobilisation (VASm) was detected. Results: There were no differences between the three groups regarding age, sex, the trauma pattern, the number and distribution of costal fracture localisations, the presence of additional pathology, complications, thoracal catheter and the duration of thoracal catheter. No significant difference between the groups regarding systolic and diastolic arterial tension, number of breaths and beats in a minute was observed (p>0.05). We observed an improvement in the mean VAS score after treatment in all three groups. The mean VASl score significantly decreased after treatment in each group (p<0.05). The mean VASl and VASm scores measured on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th days were found to be higher in Group IMO than in Groups IVPCA and TTS; however, these differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Conclusion: In the analgesia of patients with multiple rib fractures, TTS administration with ICB showed similar effectiveness with IVPCA administration with ICB. In the management of pain due to multiple rib fractures, TTS administration is a safe, non-invasive and effective procedure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Some honey types in certain geographical regions may cause toxic effects on people. This type of honey is known as “mad honey” in Turkey. The toxic ingredient of this honey is called Grayanotoxin I. The consumption of mad honey can cause severe bradycardia, hypotension, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Aims: Our study is aimed at analysing patients diagnosed with mad honey poisoning and their behaviour towards the consumption of this honey after diagnosis. Study Design: Cross sectional study. Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on complaints and findings of mad honey poisoning. Patient information and findings at the time of admission were compared with those at one month after discharge through telephone interviews. They were asked if either they or their relatives had continued consuming the same honey. Frequency data such as gender, purpose of honey consumption, first complaints and continuance of honey consumption are shown as number (n) and percentage (%). A Chi Square test was conducted to determine the difference between groups. Results: 38 patients were participated in this study; 18 of the patients had to be followed up in a coronary intensive care unit. We were able to reach 34 patients by phone after discharge. It was found that 12 of 16 patients discharged after emergency unit observation or their close relatives were continuing to consume mad honey, whereas 16 (88.9%) of the 18 patients under coronary intensive care had discontinued consuming mad honey. The difference in the continuation of mad honey consumption between patient groups followed-up in the intensive care unit and those discharged after emergency observation was statistically significant. Conclusion: Hazards associated with and serious consequences following the consumption of mad honey must be clearly explained to patients who are found to be consuming mad honey.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Background: Some honey types in certain geographical regions may cause toxic effects on people. This type of honey is known as “mad honey” in Turkey. The toxic ingredient of this honey is called Grayanotoxin I. The consumption of mad honey can cause severe bradycardia, hypotension, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Aims: Our study is aimed at analysing patients diagnosed with mad honey poisoning and their behaviour towards the consumption of this honey after diagnosis. Study Design: Cross sectional study. Methods: This cross-sectional study was based on complaints and findings of mad honey poisoning. Patient information and findings at the time of admission were compared with those at one month after discharge through telephone interviews. They were asked if either they or their relatives had continued consuming the same honey. Frequency data such as gender, purpose of honey consumption, first complaints and continuance of honey consumption are shown as number (n) and percentage (%).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Oxidative stress is believed to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective role of alpha-lipoic acid (α-LA) on oleic acid (OA)-induced ALI in rats. Study Design: Animal experiment. Methods: A total of thirty-five rats were divided into five groups in the study. Group 1 served as a control group. Rats in Group 2 (α-LA) were administered α-LA intraperitoneally at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight (BW). Rats in Group 3 (OA) were administered OA intravenously at a dose of 100 mg/kg BW. In Group 4 (pre-OA-α-LA), α-LA was given 15 minutes prior to OA infusion, and in Group 5 (post-OA-α-LA), α-LA was given two hours after OA infusion. Four hours after the OA infusion, rats were decapitated. Blood samples were collected to measure serum levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH), and the levels of activity for superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). Lung tissue samples were taken for histopathological examination. Results: Exposure to OA resulted in increases in serum MDA levels (p<0.001), as well as histopathological lesions in lung tissue, and decreases in CAT (p<0.05), GSH-Px (p<0.05) activities and GSH (p<0.05) levels. On the other hand, MDA levels were decreased significantly (p<0.001), while CAT (p<0.05), GSH-Px (p<0.01) activities and GSH (p<0.05) levels were increased significantly in the pre-OA-α-LA group compared with the OA group.

This is rarely observed in adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary glands. Case Report: A 39 year-old woman presented with a painless mass at the left submandibulary region that had been growing slowly for 5 years. Submandibulary mass resection revealed a mass with peripheral adenoid cystic carcinoma and a central high-grade tumor delineated with a fibrous rim, raising the possibility of a hybrid or composite carcinoma, requiring differential diagnosis depending upon morphology and immunohistochemistry findings. The final histopathological diagnosis was high-grade transformation of adenoid cystic carcinoma. After surgical therapy, the patient was irradiated to the neck and submandibulary region. No sign of tumor recurrence has been evident for 36 months.
