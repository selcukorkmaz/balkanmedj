    "abstract": "Background: Functional preservation of cranial nerves remains an issue in surgical treatment of vestibular schwannoma.Aims: To explore the functional outcomes of vestibular schwannoma removed by microsurgery via a retrosigmoid transmeatal approach with intraoperative monitoring techniques.Study Design: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on a group of patients with vestibular schwannoma operated by microsurgery.Methods: The outcomes, including the extent of tumor removal, the anatomic positions of the facial nerve, and postoperative Karnofsky performance status score, facial nerve function, and hearing function were reviewed and were statistically compared among tumor sizes (small, medium, and giant) and intraoperative monitoring types [electrophysiological monitoring only (E), electrophysiological monitoring + intraoperative imaging examination (E+I), and electrophysiological monitoring + neuronavigation (E+N)].Results: A total of 436 patients with VS received microsurgery. The position of the facial nerve was anterior in 85.5% of cases with small vestibular schwannoma. Other position patterns, especially anterior–superior and anterior–inferior, increased in tumors > 2.0 cm. Total resections were performed in all patients with small vestibular schwannoma. A total of 98.1% and 84.8% of patients with medium and giant vestibular schwannoma, respectively, had total resections. More than 90% of patients in all of the 3 monitoring groups had total resections. More than 80% of patients had excellent Karnofsky performance status score regardless of tumor size and monitoring type. After surgery, 100%, 84.4%, and 59.8% of patients with small-, medium-, and giant-sized vestibular schwannoma, respectively, had good facial nerve function. More than 70% of patients in all of the 3 monitoring groups had good facial nerve function postoperatively. The hearing preservation rate was 26.7% and 7.7% in small- and medium-sized vestibular schwannoma, respectively, and was 21.6% and 27.3% in the E group and the E+N group, respectively. The statistical analyses showed that tumor size was significantly associated with the extent of tumor resection, facial nerve localization, complications, postoperative Karnofsky performance status score, facial nerve function, and hearing function (all P ≤ .001). Monitoring type was significantly associated with the extent of resection (P ≤ .001). Additionally, patients in the E+N group had higher total resection rates than those in the E group (P ≤ .001). No cerebrospinal fluid leakage and surgery-related death occurred.Conclusion: In vestibular schwannoma microsurgery, tumor size is an important parameter that affects the localization of the facial nerve, the extent of resection, postoperative outcomes and complications. Intraoperative electrophysiological techniques combined with neuronavigation may be helpful to improve the extent of resection.",

According to clinical severity, patients were divided into 5 groups as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, or critical. We classified the outbreak into 3 periods. The first was between April 2, 2020, the date when the first pediatric case of our hospital was detected, and June 1, 2020, when restrictive measures were relaxed. The second period was between June 1, 2020 and November 15, 2020, when restrictive measures were reimplemented. The third period was between November 15, 2020 and January 16, 2021.Results: A total of 600 patients [median age: 10.3 years (IQR: 4.4-15.1); 304 females] were enrolled. Among them, 25.0% were asymptomatic, while the 3 most common symptoms among symptomatic cases were fever, cough, and fatigue. There was contact with a COVID-19 PCRpositive individual in 73.5% of the cases, with 76.6% of those being a household contact. There were 23 (3.9%) moderate, severe, or critical cases in terms of clinical severity. The presence of chronic disease, a pathological physical chest examination, and procalcitonin levels of >0.05 ng/mL were identified as predictors of being moderate, severe, or critical. Twenty-four (4.0%) patients were admitted to the hospital; 14 (2.3%) to the ward and 10 (1.6%) to the pediatric intensive care unit. In the second intervention period, we observed a rapidly increasing number of new cases daily, especially in August. From September, an increase was observed, being particularly marked from October to November 18. Since then, there was a decrease in the daily number of cases.Conclusion: The majority of the cases were asymptomatic or had a mild clinical presentation.

    "previewText": "Background: COVID-19 is an emerging disease of global public health concern.Aims: To evaluate the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings and the clinical outcomes of children who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and to evaluate the effect of the trends in intervention measures.Study Design: Between April 2, 2020 and January 16, 2021, children aged 0-18 years who had presented at the pediatric emergency department and were diagnosed with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by PCR were enrolled.Methods: Details on demographics, epidemiologic characteristics, clinical findings, laboratory data, and radiologic investigations, hospital admissions, and prognosis were recorded. According to clinical severity, patients were divided into 5 groups as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe, or critical. We classified the outbreak into 3 periods. The first was between April 2, 2020, the date when the first pediatric case of our hospital was detected, and June 1, 2020, when restrictive measures were relaxed. The second period was between June 1, 2020 and November 15, 2020, when restrictive measures were reimplemented. The third period was between November 15, 2020 and January 16, 2021.Results: A total of 600 patients [median age: 10.3 years (IQR: 4.4-15.1); 304 females] were enrolled. Among them, 25.0% were asymptomatic, while the 3 most common symptoms among symptomatic cases were fever, cough, and fatigue. There was contact with a COVID-19 PCRpositive individual in 73.5% of the cases, with 76.6% of those being a household contact. There were 23 (3.9%) moderate, severe, or critical cases in terms of clinical severity. The presence of chronic disease, a pathological physical chest examination, and procalcitonin levels of >0.05 ng/mL were identified as predictors of being moderate, severe, or critical. Twenty-four (4.0%) patients were admitted to the hospital; 14 (2.3%) to the ward and 10 (1.6%) to the pediatric intensive care unit. In the second intervention period, we observed a rapidly increasing number of new cases daily, especially in August. From September, an increase was observed, being particularly marked from October to November 18. Since then, there was a decrease in the daily number of cases.Conclusion: The majority of the cases were asymptomatic or had a mild clinical presentation. The presence of chronic disease, a pathological physical chest examination, and procalcitonin levels of >0.05 ng/mL were identified as predictors of being moderate, severe, or critical in terms of clinical severity. Strict intervention measures seem to be effective in containing the spread of COVID-19.",

The relationship between clinical pathologic features as well as the survival rate and CircCCT3 expression was analyzed with chi-square test and the Kaplan–Meier method. CCK-8, wound healing, transwell assays, and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-AnnexinV/propidium iodide (FITC-AnnexinV/PI) assay were used to assess cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis after CircCCT3 overexpression or downregulation. The Dual-Luciferase reporter assay, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA pull-down and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays were performed to validate the potential interaction of CircCCT3, miR-613, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA). The nude mouse xenograft tumor assay was used to detect CircCCT3 effects on pancreatic tumorigenesis in vivo. Western blotting analysis was performed to examine the VEGFA and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) protein expressions following.Results: CircCCT3 expression was significantly increased in PC tissues (3.41 ± 0.57 vs. 1.00 ± 0.10, P < .01) and cell lines (Patu8988 2.57 ± 0.20; SW1990 2.88 ± 0.10; BxPC-3 2.45 ± 0.20; Panc02 2.99 ± 0.10 vs. H6c7 1.00 ± 0.10; all P < .001). CircCCT3 expression was negatively correlated with miR-613 expression. PC patients with high CircCCT3 expression exhibited significantly poorer overall survival rate than those patients with low CircCCT3 expression (P = .013). Moreover, it was found that CircCCT3 promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and inhibited cell apoptosis in PC cells. The CircCCT3 acted as a sponge for the miR-613 to facilitate VEGFA and VEGFR2 expression. si-CirCCT3 also inhibited tumor growth of PC in nude mice. si-CircCCT3 reduced VEGFA and VEGFR2 expression, whereas overexpression of CircCCT3 increased VEGFA and VEGFR2 expression.Conclusion: Increased CircCCT3 suggests a poor prognosis for PC patients and promotes the migration and invasion through targeting VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling. CircCCT3 may serve as a potential and promising therapeutic target for PC treatment.",

The finding of clonality of B or T-cell receptors in cases pathologically diagnosed as orbital inflammatory pseudotumor has unknown clinicopathologic significance.

CD138, IgG, and IgG4 showed varying numbers of plasma cells in each case, with 5 cases (5/13, 38%) exhibiting relative increase in the presence of IgG4 plasma cells. However, no cases showed diagnostic findings of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). polymerase chain reactions analysis showed clonal B-cell populations in 2 cases (2/13, 15%).
