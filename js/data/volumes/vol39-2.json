    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Mitochondrial diseases are a clinically heterogeneous group of rare hereditary disorders that are defined by a genetic defect predominantly affecting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations of genes encoded by either nuclear DNA or mitochondrial DNA. Hundreds of different mitochondrial DNA point mutations and large-scale mitochondrial DNA rearrangements have been shown to cause mitochondrial diseases including Kearns–Sayre syndrome, Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy, Leigh syndrome, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers, mitochondrial encephalopathy lactic acidosis stroke.Aims: To investigate new variants that could be associated with mitochondrial diseases and to determine the effect of mitochondrial DNA mutations on the clinical spectrum.Study Design: Cross-sectional study.Methods: We screened whole mitochondrial DNA genome using next-generation sequencing in 16 patients who are considered to have mitochondrial disease. CentoGene and Mikrogen Genetic Diseases Diagnostic Center’s database were used to investigate sequence variants. Detected variants were evaluated in bioinformatic databases to determine pathogenicity and were classified as class 1 (pathogenic), class 2 (likely pathogenic), and class 3 (variant of uncertain significance) according to CentoGene-ACMG database.Results: As a result of the study, 2 patients were diagnosed with Leigh syndrome as previously reported class 1 mutations in MT-ATP6 and MT-ND5 genes. Four variants were identified for the first time in literature and 2 variants, previously reported but with uncertain pathogenic effect, are thought to be associated with mitochondrial disease.Conclusion: Mitochondrial DNA screening should be among the primary clinical tests in patients with suspected mitochondrial disease to rule out DNA-associated mutations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Rapamycin was shown to reduce transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) expression, inhibit the Mammalian target of rapamycin function, and prevent TGF-β1-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Rapamycin-eluting stents (RES) were successfully used to prevent coronary artery restenosis. Urethral stricture is one of the most challenging problems in urology. Thus, combining the pharmacological effects of rapamycin and the mechanical support of the stent on the urethra may prevent urethral stricture formation. However, the use of RES for urethral stricture treatment has not been studied.Aims: To observe the effects of RES in urethral stricture in a rabbit model.Study Design: Animal experimentation.Methods: Twenty adult male New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into control, urethral stricture model, bare-metal stent, and RES groups. The rabbits in the control group underwent urethroscopy alone without electrocoagulation. The rabbit model of urethral stricture was established by electrocoagulation using a self-made electrocoagulation device under direct vision using ureteroscopy. After model establishment, the rabbits in the bare-metal stent and RES groups received stent placement by ureteroscopy. On day 30, retrograde urethrography was performed to assess urethral stricture formation, ureteroscopy to remove the stents, and histological examinations to assess the degree of fibrosis. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis were used to evaluate the expression levels of TGF-β1, Smad3, and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1).Results: Urethral stricture formation was seen in the model group, whereas not in the bare-metal stent group. The bare-metal stents did not displace but were difficult to remove. In the RES group, RES was dislodged in itself at postoperative day 27 in one rabbit, whereas successfully removed by ureteroscopy in the remaining four rabbits, and urethral stricture formation was not seen on retrograde urethrography after stent removal. Histological examination revealed a large number of dense fibroblasts and blue-stained collagen fibers in the bare-metal stent group, whereas the number of fibroblasts and collagen fibers under the mucosa was reduced in the RES group. RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses showed that the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression of TGF-b1and Smad3 was significantly decreased, and mRNA and protein expression of MMP1 was significantly increased in the RES group than that in the model (P < 0.001) and bare-metal stent groups (P < 0.001).Conclusion: RES can effectively prevent electrocoagulation-induced urethral stricture in rabbits. The mechanism may be related to the effect of rapamycin on inhibiting TGF-β1 and Smad3 expression and promoting MMP1 expression in urethral tissues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The prediction of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) failure in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) having acute respiratory failure (ARF) may prevent delayed intubation and decrease mortality.Aims: To define the related risk factors to HFNO failure and hospital mortalityStudy Design: Retrospective cohort study.Methods: To this study, 85 critically ill patients (≥18 years) with COVID-19 related acute kidney injury who were treated with HFNO were enrolled. Treatment success was defined as the de-escalation of the oxygenation support to the conventional oxygen therapies. HFNO therapy failure was determined as the need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death. The patients were divided into HFNO-failure (HFNO-F) and HFNO-success (HFNO-S) groups. Electronic medical records and laboratory data were screened for all patients. Respiratory rate oxygenation (ROX) index on the first hour and chest computed tomography (CT) severity score were calculated. Factors related to HFNO therapy failure and mortality were defined.Results: This study assessed 85 patients (median age 67 years, 69.4% male) who were divided into two groups as HFNO success (n = 33) and HFNO failure (n = 52). The respiratory rate oxygenation (ROX) was measured at 1 hour and the computed tomography (CT) score indicated HFNO failure and intubation, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.695 for the ROX index and 0.628 for the CT score. A ROX index of <3.81 and a CT score of >15 in the first hour of therapy were the predictors of HFNO failure and intubation. Age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, arterial blood gas findings “(i.e., partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2], PaO2 [fraction of inspired oxygen]/SO2 [oxygen saturation] ratio)”, and D-dimer levels were also associated with HFNO failure; however, based on logistic regression analysis, a calculated ROX on the first hour of therapy of <3.81 (odds ratio [OR] = 4.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.75–13.02, P = 0.001) and a chest CT score of >15 (OR = 2.83, 95% CI = 1.01–7.88, P = <0.001) were the only independent risk factors. In logistic regression analysis, a ROX calculated on the first hour of therapy of <3.81 (OR = 4.78, [95% CI = 1.75–13.02], P = 0.001) and a chest CT score of >15 (OR 2.83, 95% CI = 1.01–7.88, P = <0.001) were the independent risk factors for the HFNO failure. The intensive care unit and hospital mortality rates were 80.2% and 82.7%, respectively, in the HFNO failure group.Conclusion: The early prediction of HFNO therapy failure is essential considering the high mortality rate in patients with HFNO therapy failure. Using the ROX index and the chest CT severity score combined with the other clinical parameters may reduce mortality. Additionally, multi-centre observational studies are needed to define the predictive value of ROX and chest CT score not only for COVID-19 but also other causes of ARF.",

Thus, this study evaluated the prevalence of norovirus in stool samples of hospitalized patients with acute gastroenteritis in Aydin, Turkey using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and genotyped positive samples to detect which genotypes have currently circulated.Methods: This retrospective descriptive study collected 92 stool samples from patients with acute gastroenteritis symptoms from Aydın Adnan Menderes University Hospital from September 2017 to May 2019. The samples were tested using the commercial Third Generation Ridascreen norovirus ELISA and rRT-PCR. Positive samples were genotyped by sequencing of conventional positive RT-PCR products followed by phylogenetic analysis.Results: Of the 92 samples, 5 (5.4%) using ELISA and 12 (13%) using rRT-PCR tested positive for norovirus. All positive samples were genogroup II (GII). Two norovirus positive samples were genotyped successfully using DNA sequencing of the nested conventional PCR products. One sample (GII/Hu/TR/2019/Aydin25) could be categorized as GII.3 and the other (GII/Hu/TR/2019/Aydin20) as GII.13.Conclusion: rRT-PCR testing of stool samples is more sensitive than Ridascreen ELISA.
