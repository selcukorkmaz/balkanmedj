The most common and representative AIBD is chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), which is also known as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis. Another variant of CNO, which is typically observed in older teenagers or adults, is known as synovitis, acne, hyperostosis, pustulosis, osteitis syndrome.

Aims: We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the impact of postoperative EN, PN, and EN + PN in patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CNKI, Wan Fang, and VIP were searched from conception until January 2, 2024.

The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool was used to assess the quality of the RCTs. Fixed- and random-effects models were chosen according to the heterogeneity of variables for the synthesis of results. Continuous and categorical variables were analyzed using the weighted mean difference or relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: In this meta-analysis, 11 RCTs were included. The PN + EN group exhibited significantly improved postoperative recovery, nutritional function, and immune indicators than the PN and EN groups (p < 0.05).

Aims: To assess ways in which PBUTs alter the CYP450 enzymes in hepatocytes as well as the possible effects of specific PBUTs on the metabolism and excretion of atorvastatin (ATV). Study Design: An experimental study. Methods: The experimental group was treated with long-term MHD for > 3 months, estimated-glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) < 15 ml/min, normal Alb level (35.0-55.0 g/l), and no urine; the control group was not treated with hemodialysis, e-GFR < 60 ml/min, normal Alb level, and normal urinary excretion function. A suitable UPLC-MS/MS method was developed for detecting the concentration of 4-hydroxy ATV. Fresh primary hepatocytes were isolated from rats, and the uptake of ATV was tested in the uremic serum (US) group, IS group, and HA group and compared with that in the normal serum group. The metabolic status of ATV in the US group, IS group, and HA group was compared with that in the ATV group. RLM were extracted, and the metabolic experiment of ATV was performed in a human CYP3A4 model. The influence of UTs on pregnane X receptor (PXR)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) mRNA and the protein expression was also detected. Results: IS and HA inhibited the ATV metabolism to varying degrees, wherein IS was the most potent inhibitor, producing > 50% inhibition. Meanwhile, the protein expression of CYP3A4 was downregulated after incubation with US, IS, and HA (p < 0.01). The excretion of ATV was also inhibited by 59.24% and 71.95% after incubation with IS and HA, respectively. The effects of uremic toxins on PXR/NF-κB mRNA and protein expression elucidated that PBUTs can inhibit ATV uptake and metabolism by exerting inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 through the PXR/NF-κB signaling pathway. Conclusion: ATV metabolism could be significantly altered in the presence of uremic toxins, suggesting a downregulated effect on the ATV uptake, possibly through Oatp1b1, and also on the activity of CYP3A4 through the PXR/NF-κB signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Since January 2015, the Cystic Fibrosis National Newborn Bloodspot Screening (CF-NBS) program has been implemented in Türkiye with two samples of immune reactive trypsinogen (IRT-1/IRT-2) testing. Aims: To evaluate the Turkish national CF screening program, which included patients referred to a tertiary pediatric pulmonology center, to ascertain the optimal cut-off values for IRT-1/IRT-2 and to identify alternative strategies for mitigating the number of late-diagnosed false-negative patients (FNPs) who initially exhibited screen negative results but were diagnosed subsequently based on clinical suspicion. The study also compared NBS-positive patients to FNPs to determine the influence of delayed diagnosis. Study Design: A retrospective cohort study. Methods: Screening for CF was conducted in accordance with the national CF-NBS program within 48-72 hours of birth by collecting a few drops of heel blood on Guthrie paper. A cut-off value of 90 µg/l was accepted for the first IRT, while 70 µg/l was accepted for the second sample. Infants with elevated IRT values in both samples were referred to the CF centers for a sweat test (ST). Based on the diagnosis, the NBS-positive infants referred to our CF center for ST analysis were divided into three groups: CF; cystic fibrosis-related metabolic syndrome/cystic fibrosis screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis (CRMS/CFSPID); and false-positive NBS. In addition, the study included NBS-negative patients who initially received negative screen results but were subsequently diagnosed with CF based on clinical suspicion. Results: Of the 227 NBS-positive infants referred within the study period, 53 (23.34%) were diagnosed with CF (true-positive NBS), 11 were classified as CRMS/CFSPID (4.84%), and 163 were classified as false-positive NBS (71.8%). CF was diagnosed in 66 infants, 53 (80.3%) of whom were confirmed using the NBS test, while the 13 (19.7%) patients who were missed on the NBS test were diagnosed based on clinical suspicion (FNP). The study findings indicate that the IRT/IRT approach exhibited a sensitivity of 80.3% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 23.3%. Conclusion: The current study is the first to analyze the NBS program for CF using data from the Western Anatolian Region of Türkiye. Due to the low sensitivity and PPV of the IRT/IRT protocol and the high proportion of false-positive infants and FNPs, the current national program is not practicable for Türkiye. False-negative results significantly delay the diagnosis and invalidate the screening objectives. It is essential to establish optimal cut-off values for IRT-1/IRT-2 or revise existing strategies to reduce the number of FNPs missed by the screening program.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent solid cancer affecting women’s health globally. Matrine (MAT), a traditional Chinese herb, has exhibited antitumor effects against BC. However, its mechanism of action, particularly whether it involves the control of cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), remains unknown. Aims: To explore MAT’s role in BC and its regulatory mechanisms, as well as to identify targets for the development of novel medicines and improvement of BC treatment modalities. Study Design: Experimental study. Methods: The UALCAN and Lnc2Cancer 3.0 databases were used to predict the expression of LINC01116 in BC. The BC cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) were treated with various concentrations of MAT, and the optimal dose and timing of MAT action were determined using CCK-8 and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. Functional assays such as CCK-8, EdU, Transwell, Western blot, and flow cytometry assays were performed on the BC cells, and the impacts of LINC01116, miR-9-5p, and ITGB1 expression levels on MAT’s mechanism of action were assessed. The association between LINC01116, miR-9-5p, and ITGB1 was evaluated using dual luciferase and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, the size and weight of the subcutaneous tumors in mice model were assessed. The effect of LINC01116 overexpression on the in vivo action of MAT and histopathological staining (TUNEL immunofluorescence, hematoxylin & eosin staining, immunohistochemistry staining for Ki67 and Bax) were also assessed. Results: The optimal dose and duration of MAT administration were 8 µm and 24 h, respectively. MAT effectively inhibited BC cell proliferation, EMT progression, and biological functions, while promoting BC cell apoptosis. The animal model experiments also demonstrated that MAT inhibited BC tumor growth in vivo. Furthermore, MAT inhibited LINC01116, which acted as a sponge for miR-9-5p, increasing the ITGB1 level. Conclusion: MAT suppresses BC cell and EMT proliferation via the LINC01116/miR-9-5p/ITGB1 pathway. Thus, MAT may be a promising target for adjuvant anti-BC therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The platelet-albumin-bilirubin (PALBI) grade is a comprehensive assessment index of liver function. Liver dysfunction is a key determinant of the pathogenesis and resolution of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which affects the prognosis of patients. Aims: To evaluate the association of PALBI grade with the risk of 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between PALBI grade and the 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS; results were described as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This association was further assessed by subgroup analyses stratified based on age, sex, and complications. Results: A total of 2,841 patients with ARDS were included, of whom, 703 (24.74%) died within 30 days. After adjusting all covariates, a higher PALBI grade was associated with higher odds of 30-day mortality (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.05-2.29). High PALBI grade was related to higher odds of 30-day mortality in patients with ARDS aged ≥ 65 years (HR: 2.30, 95% CI: 1.06-5.01), males (HR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.29-3.44), without sepsis (HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.11-2.64), without pneumonia (HR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.19-2.91), and without any history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR: 1.93, 95% CI: 1.28-2.91).
