Patients and Methods: The study included 48 patients (46 males, 2 females) who were operated on for pilonidal sinus. The patients were randomized to two groups. After sinus excision, 33 patients (group 1) underwent primary closure, and 15 patients (group 2) underwent Karydakis flap surgery. The mean followup was 6.8 months (range 4 to 11 months) in group 1, and 6.2 months (range 3 to 10 months) in group 2. Results: Serous liquid collection and discharge were seen at the site of the lesion in four patients (12.1%) in group 1, and in two patients (13.3%) in group 2. Subcutaneous hematoma was detected in one patient (6.7%) in group 2. During the follow-up period, none of the patients developed wound infection. Recurrences were seen in one patient (3%) in group 1, and in one patient (6.7%) in group 2. Conclusion: Excision and primary closure can be the preferred method for the treatment of pilonidal sinus in selected patients due to its advantages such as ease and simplicity, shorter recovery time, and limited scar formation.",

This study retrospectively reviewed medical records of four patients who underwent urgent surgery due to intraperitoneal rupture and the records of all patients treated for hepatic hydatidosis in the same period. Patients and Methods: Medical records of the 44 patients (24 females, 20 males; mean age 47.5 years; range 16 to 83 years) who were treated in our clinic for hepatic hydatidosis between January 2004 and June 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were evaluated with respect to age, sex, location of the cyst, surgical method applied, hospital stay duration, pre- and postoperative complications, and treatment methods applied for the complications. Results:Four patients (9%) underwent emergency surgery due to intraperitoneal rupture. Postoperative biliary leakage into the cyst cavity was observed in 15 patients (34%). It was closed spontaneously in 6 patients (40%) without further intervention. In 8 patients (53%) the biliary leakage continued for about 10 days and the daily median drainage was over 100 cc. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in these cases. Mortality rate was 4% (n=2). Conclusion: Rupture of hydatid cyst should be suspected in trauma patients who had hepatic cyst and intraperitoneal free fluid concomitantly. In these patients therapeutic intervention should be quick because of the risk of any anaflactic reaction.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The C825T polymorphism of the gene encoding the G-protein beta-3 subunit (GNB3) is associated with enhanced signal transduction via G proteins which in turn results in an increased Na+/H+ exchanger activity. This ion transport system mediates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Increased activity of Na+/H+ exchanger was found in the cells of patients with arterial hypertension in different populations. We investigated this polymorphism in a Turkish group of patients with hypertension and compared them with normotensive subjects. Patients and Methods: 99 hypertensive patients (57 males, 42 females) and 45 normotensive controls (33 males, 12 females) were genotyped for the GNB3 C825T polymorphism. Results: Allele distribution of patient and control groups were CC: 35, CT: 51, TT: 13 and CC: 26, CT: 15, TT: 4, respectively. T-allele carriers (CT and TT) were significantly higher in hypertensive group. There was also a statistically significant (Chi-square test, p=0.041) relationship between 825T allele and hypertension. Conclusion: These results suggest that hypertension is related with GNB3 polymorphism in Turkish patients and increased G protein activity may be the pathophysiologic link between C825T and hypertension.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: We planned this study to evaluate the proliferative activity of the oral mucosal epithelial cells of smokers and non-smokers via nuclear morphometry and AgNOR counts. Patients and Methods: Smears were collected from normal-appearing mouth floor mucosa of 40 non-smokers and 40 smokers between ages of 50 and 70. AgNORs were counted in the first 50 well-fixed, nucleated squamous cells and nuclear areas were calculated via computerized image analyzing system. Results: Statistically mean AgNOR numbers per nucleus in the nonsmoking group (3.47±0.30) was lower than the smoking group (4.22±0.39, p<0.001), and mean nuclear areas of squamous cells of smokers (94.32±10.08) was also significantly higher than non-smokers (87±9.4, p<0.05). The mean number of nuclei having more than 5 AgNORs was 14.6% and 36.8% in non-smokers and smokers, respectively. Conclusion: Our results support that smoking is a severe risk factor for oral mucosal proliferative lesions and exfoliative cytology can be the preferred method for screening of oral mucosal lesions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Patients with extended cholesteatoma who underwent Combined Heermann And Tos (CHAT) technique, which we developed depending on our studies on Heermann’s “cartilage palisade tympanoplasty“ and Tos’ “modified combined approach tympanoplasty“, were analyzed. Patients and Methods: The study included 37 ears of 35 patients, in whom CHAT technique was performed. Posterior-superior bony annulus was widely drilled, transmeatal atticotomy and cortical mastoidectomy with preservation of posterior ear canal wall were performed in each patient. After ossiculoplasty, perforation of the eardrum, opening at bony annulus and scutum were reconstructed with the palisade technique. At the final evaluation, otoscopic and audiologic findings were evaluated and compared (Paired Sample t-test). Results: Median age was 33 (6-57), mean follow-up period was 30 months (range: 6-60; standard deviation: 19). There was no complication in any patient before or after the surgery. There was two (5%) recurrent cholesteatomas (eradication: 95%), one of which was local. The mean hearing and air-bone gap preoperatively versus in last evaluation were 45 (standard deviation: 14) vs 35 dB (standard deviation: 16) (p<0.0001) and 29 (standard deviation: 11) vs 21 dB (standard deviation: 11), respectively (p<0.001). Conclusion: We conclude that CHAT technique is quite successful in the eradication of extensive cholesteatoma with satisfactory results in hearing, although it is a one-stage, canal wall up closed technique.",

He had purulent conjunctivitis, hyperemia in nasal mucosa, pseudomembranous stomatitis in his mouth, inflammation in external urethral orifice, vesiculobullous lesions in both hands and feet. Nikolsky sign was positive. The patient was diagnosed as Stevens- Johnson syndrome and hospitalized in intensive care unit. Intravenous fluid replacement treatment, ceftriaxone sodium, ranitidine, nystatin and methylprednisolone were started. In addition, he received five sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (at 2.5 atmospheres absolute for 90 minutes/day). The lesions were markedly improved after three days and he was completely healed after five days of treatment. In this case report, the potential role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of cutaneous and mucosal manifestations of Stevens-Johnson syndrome was discussed.",

Postoperative wound seromas ocur in up to 53% of all patients undergoing mastectomies.

The seroma was refractory to all conventional treatments,and required surgical resection.
