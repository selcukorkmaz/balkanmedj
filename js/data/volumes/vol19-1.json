Serum total and lipid-bound sialic acid levels were determined by the methods of Warren and Katopodis, respectively. The results were compared with the use of one-way ANOVA test. Results: Serum total and lipid-bound sialic acid levels were significantly higher in patients with coronary obstruction (81.01±10.10 mg/dl and 33.59±7.00 mg/dl, respectively) when compared with those of patients with no obstruction (65.18±10.23 mg/dl and 25.28±7.40 mg/dl, respectively) (p<0.001).

Body proportions were determined using anthropometric measuring techniques, and percent adiposity with the use of a Holtain skinfold caliper according to the Yuhasz' technique.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: We investigated the role of central histaminergic system on learning and memory functions in mice and rats. Study Design: Learning and memory functions were investigated using elevated plus-maze test in mice and radialarm maze test in rats. The mice were placed in the maze for 60 seconds on the first day to allow them to learn the maze. Twenty-four hours later, they were put in the maze again to record the time spent to enter one of the closed arms. The effects of pyrilamine, ranitidine, thioperamide and histidine injected one hour before the test were examined in diverse groups of mice whose memory functions were intact or impaired by scopolamine injection 15 minutes before the test. In the radial-arm maze test, the rats were allowed to find food placed in four arms of the maze for seven days. On the eighth day, diverse groups were assigned to receive pyrilamine, ranitidine, thioperamide, histamine, and histidine. Histidine and histamine were also given following induction of tuberomammillary nucleus lesions and the modulation of histamine effects by pyrilamine, ranitidine, and thioperamide was tested. Results: Pyrilamine, ranitidine, thioperamide, histidine, and histamine had no effect on memory functions. Histidine increased memory retention in mice with scopolamine-induced deficits in elevated plus-maze performance; this effect was blocked by pyrilamine, but not affected by ranitidine and thioperamide. In rats with tuberomammillary nucleus region lesions, prolongation of the completion period of the test and working memory failures were observed; but there were no changes on reference memory failures. These deteriorations were improved by histamine and histidine. The enhancing effect of histamine on memory was antagonized by pyrilamine, but remained unchanged by ranitidine and thioperamide. Conclusion: These results show that central histaminergic system has an enhancing effect on memory function and this effect is mediated by histamine H1 receptors.",

Study Design: Thoracic aorta segments obtained from 30 male Wistar rats were suspended in organ baths containing Krebs solution and isometric contractions and relaxations were recorded. The contractile and the relaxant effects of histamine and compound 48/80 in resting and phenylephrine-precontracted aortic strips were recorded both in endothelium-intact and –denuded preparations. The antagonistic effects of H1 receptor antagonist, pheniramine, and H2 receptor antagonist, cimetidine on these responses were investigated. Results: Histamine per se produced contractile responses in all samples. While pheniramine, histamine H1-receptor antagonist, prevented histamine-induced contractile responses, cimetidine, H2-receptor antagonist, had no effect. Histamine produced relaxation in the submaximally contracted endothelial samples by phenylephrine, but no relaxation was observed in preparations without endothelium. Pheniramine prevented the relaxation of preparations with intact endothelium, whereas cimetidine had no effect. Compound 48/80, which releases histamine from mast cells, had no effect on either contraction or relaxation. Conclusion: Histamine have both a contractile and endothelium-dependent relaxation effect on isolated rat aorta, mediated by H1-receptors.",
