As previously reported, immunoglobulin G (IgG) can modulate oxidative stress in various disorders.Aims: To investigate whether IgG treatment can alleviate oxidative stress caused by Zn0 on microglia in vitro.Study Design: In vitro study.Methods: The feasibility of Zn0 treatment was evaluated using the MTS assay. Oxidative stress following treatment with Zn0, either alone or with IgG supplementation, was determined with dihydrorhodamine 123 staining. Flow cytometry was employed to ascertain the intracellular protein levels of TRIM21, PINK, PARKIN, MFN2, Beclin-1, and active LC3B.Results: In silico screening confirmed the association between Zn0 cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Furthermore, oxidative stress was identified as a critical mechanism that underlies Zn0 neurotoxicity. The in silico analysis revealed that Zn can interact with the constant region of the Ig heavy chain, suggesting a potential role for IgG in alleviating Zn0-induced cytotoxicity. Experimental findings supported this hypothesis, as IgG administration significantly reduced Zn0-induced mitochondrial stress in a dose-dependent manner. The upregulation of PINK1 levels by Zn0 exposure suggests that mitochondrial injury promotes mitophagy. Interestingly, Zn0 decreased TRIM21 levels, which is reversed by IgG administration.Conclusion: These findings elucidate the cellular responses to Zn0 and highlight the potential use of intravenous immunoglobulin in mitigating the adverse effects of acute Zn0 exposure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Emerging carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) (CRKP) bacteremias are presenting significant public health risks due to limited treatment options and increased mortality. K. pneumoniae isolates exhibit carbapenem resistance rates that vary from 25% to 50% throughout the European continent, including our country.Aims: To assess the characteristics of CRKP bacteremia, a condition that has recently demonstrated an increasing prevalence in our center. We sought to ascertain the resistance rates of isolated strains to antibiotics other than carbapenems, identify the responsible carbapenemase genes, evaluate the efficacy of antibiotics, determine mortality rates, explore clonality among strains, and investigate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on all these factors.Study Design: Retrospective observational study.Methods: This study included patients aged 18 and older who had experienced meropenem-resistant K. pneumoniae bacteremia. Meropenem resistance was confirmed by employing the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Meropenem minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) levels were determined using the gradient test, while colistin MIC levels were ascertained using the disk elution technique. Carbapenemase genes were evaluated via colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and clonality analysis was performed using the arbitrarily primed PCR technique.Results: The study comprised 230 patients, with a mean age of 63.1 ± 15.9 years, of whom 58.7% were male. Oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48) was detected in 74.8% of the patients, New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) in 12.6%, OXA-48 + NDM in 7.8%, and KPC in 4.8%. The 14-day and 30-day mortality rates were 57% and 69.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis of the 30-day mortality revealed several crucial factors, including bacteremia development in the intensive care unit, the occurrence of bacteremia during the COVID-19 pandemic, polymicrobial bacteremia, the use of indwelling intravenous catheters, a platelet count of ≤ 140,000/µl, procalcitonin levels of ≥ 6 µg/l, and a Charlson comorbidity score ≥ 3. Notably, the OXA-48 and KPC genes were upregulated significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the NDM gene groups were downregulated. Additionally, both 14-day and 30-day mortality rates increased significantly.Conclusion: In this study, the most prevalent carbapenemase gene was OXA-48; however, there has been a recent increase in KPC genes. No dominant epidemic strain was identified through clonality analysis. The clustering rate was 68% before the pandemic, increasing to 85.7% during the pandemic. The significance of infection control measures is underscored by the rise in both clustering and mortality rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play a key role in regenerative medicine due to their capacity to differentiate into multiple cell lines, regulate the immune system, and exert paracrine effects. The therapeutic impact of MSCs is primarily mediated through their secretome. The secretory and therapeutic potential of MSCs can be improved through preconditioning, which entails the application of hypoxic environments, 3-dimensional cell cultures, and pharmacological agents. Valproic acid (VPA) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor that is employed in medical practice for treating epilepsy and bipolar disorder.

The ultrastructural properties of the cells were studied under transmission electron microscopy.Results: Ultrastructural examinations revealed that the chromatin content of VPA-treated cells was reduced. VPA-preconditioned cells exhibited a higher density of rough endoplasmic reticulum, autophagic vesicles, and myelin figures on cytoplasmic structure analysis, which was indicative of increased secretion. Protein secretion was elevated in those cells, with notable increases in NGF and BDNF levels.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: In the postacute phase of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), survivors may have persistent symptoms, lung function abnormalities, and sequelae lesions on thoracic computed tomography (CT). This new entity has been defined as post-COVID interstitial lung disease (ILD) or residual disease.Aims: To evaluate the characteristics, risk factors and clinical significance of post-COVID ILD.Study Design: Multicenter cross-sectional analysis of data from a randomized clinical study.Methods: In this study, patients with persistent respiratory symptoms 3 months after recovery from COVID-19 were evaluated by two pulmonologists and a radiologist. post-COVID ILD was defined as the presence of respiratory symptoms, hypoxemia, restrictive defect on lung function tests, and interstitial changes on follow-up high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).Results: At the three-month follow-up, 375 patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome were evaluated, and 262 patients were found to have post-COVID ILD. The most prevalent complaints were dyspnea (n = 238, 90.8%), exercise intolerance (n = 166, 63.4%), fatigue (n = 142, 54.2%), and cough (n = 136, 52%). The mean Medical Research Council dyspnea score was 2.1 ± 0.9, oxygen saturation was 92.2 ± 5.9%, and 6-minute walking distance was 360 ± 140 meters. The mean diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide was 58 ± 21, and the forced vital capacity was 70% ± 19%. Ground glass opacities and fibrotic bands were the most common findings on thoracic HRCT. Fibrosis-like lesions such as interlobular septal thickening and traction bronchiectasis were observed in 38.3% and 27.9% of the patients, respectively. No honeycomb cysts were observed. Active smoking [odds ratio (OR), 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.44-2.67), intensive care unit admission during the acute phase (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.1-1.95), need for high-flow nasal oxygen (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.42-1.9) or non-invasive ventilation (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.8-2.07), and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels (OR, 1.23; 95% CI 1.18-1.28) were associated with the development of post-COVID ILD. At the 6-month follow-up, the respiratory symptoms and pulmonary functions had improved spontaneously without any specific treatment in 35 patients (13.4%). The radiological interstitial lesions had spontaneously regressed in 54 patients (20.6%).Conclusion: The co-existence of respiratory symptoms, radiological parenchymal lesions, and pulmonary functional abnormalities which suggest a restrictive ventilatory defect should be defined as post-COVID-19 ILD. However, the term “fibrosis” should be used carefully. Active smoking, severe COVID-19, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level are the main risk factors of this condition. These post-COVID functional and radiological changes could disappear over time in 20% of the patients.",

The expression of ICPs on CD4+ T and Treg cells was determined using flow cytometry, and plasma levels of soluble ICPs were estimated by ELISA.Results: Our results revealed a significant increase in the expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) on CD4+ T cells during the second and third years of SCIT, respectively.
