Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 23 high schools in Hatay in 2006 using a questionnaire consisted of General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: A total of 1629 students were given study questionnaire. Lifetime substance use prevalence was 38.8 for cigarette smoking, 30.5 for alcohol use, 30.1 for being drunk, 13.9 for regular smoking, 7.1 for volatile substance use, 1.1 for marijuana use, 0.8 for drug use such as heroin, ecstasy, and cocaine. Anxiety scores were higher in smokers while self esteem and self efficacy scores were higher in alcohol users. Exposure to physical violence and use of physical violence within the last year were higher in smokers and in all substance users. Conclusion: Cigarette, alcohol and volatile substances were frequently used among adolescents. The results show that high anxiety is related with smoking, high self esteem and self efficacy are related with alcohol use. Substance use is associated with exposure to and use of violence.",

Patients and Methods: A total of 1058 vaginal swab samples were collected. The study population included 402 symptomatic and 656 asymptomatic women, between 18-45 years of age. Specimens were taken with a speculum and sterile cotton swabs from the posterior fornix of the vagina. Wet mount preparations were examined first, and then inoculated into Trypticase-yeast extract-maltose medium. Results: T. vaginalis was determined in 35 (3.31%) samples out of 1058 specimens using both diagnostic methods (direct examination and/or culture). While a total of 402 women were symptomatic, 656 women were asymptomatic. Among 190 IUD users, the frequency of T. vaginalis was determined as 6.84%, and among 868 non-users, this ratio was determined as 2.53%. Moreover, while among 100 symptomatic women with IUD, 11 women were positive for T. vaginalis (11%), of the 302 symptomatic women without IUD, 17 were positive (5.63%) for T. vaginalis. Significant correlation was determined between the use of IUD and the presence of T. vaginalis (p<0.05). Conclusion: These results showed that IUD use may increase the growth of T. vaginalis in the vaginal mucosa.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: To investigate the effects of episiotomy repair performed before or after placental expulsion on the maternal blood values. Patients and Methods: A total of 172 pregnant women were investigated retrospectively who delivered at term (37-41 gestational weeks). The patients were divided into two groups as Group 1 who had episiotomy repair after the plasental expulsion and Group 2 who had episiotomy repair before the plasental expulsion. The hematocrit and hemoglobin values of all the pregnant women in both groups before labor and at the 12th hour in the postpartum period were compared. Results: There were no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of age, duration of labor, gestational weeks, episiotomy repair time, birth weight, and body mass index. The absolute hemoglobin difference between pre-delivery and postpartum 12th hour was 1.17±0.09 g/dl in Group 1 and 1.17±0.11 g/dl in Group 2. There were no statistically significant difference between the groups with respect to the mean episiotomy repair time and absolute hemoglobin and hematocrit differences (p=0.624, p=0.987, p=0.779). Conclusion: Timing and the type of episiotomy must be evaluated according to the conditions at the time of labor. If there are no risk factors the episiotomy repair must be done immediately to prevent the leakage bleeding, and if it is thought that the episiotomy repair can minimize the exposure it will be better to wait for the placental expulsion.",

Patients and Methods: The study included urological patients who were scheduled for elective surgery under spinal anesthesia. The cases were randomly divided into three groups of 20 patients each. Group 1 received 13.5 mg hyperbaric levobupivacaine, group 2 received 12.5 mg isobaric levobupivacaine and group 3 received 15 mg isobaric levobupivacaine in a total volume of 3 ml intrathecally. Sensory and motor block, hemodynamic parameters, pain scores, adverse effects and analgesic requirements of the patients were recorded. Results: The time to reach T10 sensory block and the onset time to Bromage 0 were statistically different among the three groups (p<0.05). The mean time to reach T10 was significantly lower in group 1 when compared with group 2 (p<0.001). Regarding the mean onset time to Bromage 0, group 1 had a lower mean value than that of group 3 (p<0.001).

Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, the records of 190 adult male patients (mean age 27.5 years; range 17 to 71 years) with brucellosis were evaluated. Ten of these cases presented with epididymo-orchitis. Among these cases, epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis were diagnosed on the basis of a typical history of gradual onset of scrotal pain and findings of enlarged tender testes and/or epididymis. Results: The most common symptoms were fever, scrotal pain, and swelling (100%). There were different focal Brucellar involvements other than the epididymo-orchitis in eight patients (80%). All of the patients had unilateral epididymo-orchitis. A testicular abscess was detected in one patient. Combined antibiotic therapy was started and continued for 6-8 weeks. Orchiectomy was required for one patient (10%) and granulomatous orchitis was detected in the resected specimens. Relapse was not observed in any patient. Conclusion: Brucellosis should be considered in the diagnosis of scrotal diseases in endemic areas. Clinical and serological data are sufficient for the diagnosis.

Surgical treatment included chest tube thoracostomy in 173 (86.5%) cases and other conservative treatment methods were applied in 27 (13.5%) cases. Thoracotomy was required in 39 (19.5%) of the cases. The morbidity rate was 7.5% and mortality rate was 0.5%. Conclusion: In penetrating thoracic trauma cases, except emergency thoracotomy patients, conservative treatment methods are applied in most of the patients. Trauma with intrathoracic organ injury increases the mortality and morbidity, and requires fast and well-organized multidisciplinary approach.",

With the results of our study, we aimed to provide a reference on the development of Turkish medicine and anatomic history for today's anatomists. Study Design: Urinary system explanations of Şanizade's work were translated into today's Turkish. The information on urinary system included in Miratü'l Ebdan fi Teşrih-i Azaü'l İnsan was compared with the information on the same topic existing in today's modern anatomy reference books. Results: Miratü'l Ebdan fi Teşrih-i Azaü'l İnsan consists of several parts on urinary system, which are kidney, capsulitis and vesica urinaria. The information about ureter is given under the part on kidney. Initially, positions of the organs, and then the physiognomy and internal structures are covered. Notably, we determined that the internal structure of kidney and the vein system is expressed in detail. Conclusion: Şanizade used Ottoman Turkish terminology when he translated the original foreign source. He expressed the knowledge of his time in the best way. There are numerous points that correspond to contemporary knowledge on urinary system. </d",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the age-related changes of oxidative injury in the brain tissues of rats produced by radiotherapy that is widely used on cancer treatment. Study Design: Fifty-five male Wistar albino rats [ages of rats were 1, 4, 12 weeks (n=10) and 1 year (n=5)] were divided into four groups. Irradiation were performed on a Cobalt-60 unit using a single fraction of 8 Gy. The brain tissues were homogenized and divided into two portions. One portion was used for the measurement of the malondialdehyde (MDA). The other portion was used for the measurement of the protein concentration, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) enzyme activities. Results: The SOD activity decreased significantly in 1-week-old rats (p<0.05). The decreases in GSHPx and CAT activities were more obvious in 1-week and 1-year-old rats than that in others. No significant changes were observed in adolescent and adult rats. The MDA levels of all groups increased. The highest MDA levels were seen in 1-year-old rats (p<0.05). Conclusion: Ionizing radiation used in radiotherapy affected antioxidant systems and increased MDA levels. These changes were more in the 1-week and 1-year-old rats than in others. This can be due to incomplete development of many systems in newborn rats and the loss of physiological capacities associated with aging in 1-year-old rats.",

This study was carried out to see if metallic residues from the bullet core can be found on teeth and if the entrance and exit sites can be determined by examining their localization in firearm bullet core injuries with tooth involvement. Study Design: 30 teeth, which were pulled with orders 1, 2 and 3 for orthodontic and prosthetic reasons, were used. A specially designed constant shot contrivance was used for firearm shots. The shots were performed with standard shotgun and full metal jacket cartridges. Shots were made from 40 cm distance and with front to back direction. The teeth were examined with stereomicroscope. Results: Metallic residue traces were found in 47.8% on the front of fractured teeth by microscopic examination. The amount of metallic residues was low in five (21.7%) teeth, moderate in three (13%) and excessive in three teeth (13%).
