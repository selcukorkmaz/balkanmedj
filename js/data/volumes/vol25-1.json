Patients and Methods: The study included16 patients (11 males, 5 females; mean age 50.3 years; range 9 to 81 years) with proximal humerus fractures. All the patients were treated with closed reduction and external fixation (9 İlizarov external fixator, 7 monolateral external fixator). After bone union was achieved, the fixators were removed and functional results were evaluated with the Constant score. The mean follow-up was 37 months (range 4 to 69 months). Results: The average union time was 14 weeks (range 8 to 22 weeks). Union did not occur in one patient. Avascular necrosis of the humeral head developed in one patient. Superficial pin tract infections were observed in three patients, all of whom were successfully treated with wound care and antibiotic therapy. The mean Constant score was 81. Conclusion: Treatment of displaced fractures of the proximal humerus with closed reduction and external fixation provides satisfactory fracture reduction and stability and functional results. <",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of treatment in patients with hydatidosis. Patients and Methods: The study included 120 patients (35 males, 85 females; mean age 40.7 years; range 7 to 75 years) who underwent treatment for hydatidosis. Data on diagnostic evaluation, medical and surgical treatments, and follow-up results were reviewed. Results: The most frequent complaints were abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Fifty-four patients were found normal on physical examination. The most frequent findings were hepatomegaly and abdominal mass. The cysts developed in other abdominal organs other than the liver in 21 patients. Treatment was medical in 16 patients, and six patients underwent PAIR (Percutaneous aspiration, injection, and reaspiration). The preferred surgical procedure was partial cystectomy. Medical treatment was added to surgery in 55 patients. The most frequent surgical complication was wound infection (12.8%). Recurrences were encountered in 16.3%. Conclusion: Conservative surgery which is the preferred option for main line of treatment is adequate and reliable for hydatidosis. Addition of medical agents may increase treatment success rate.",

The following data were recorded for both groups: hemodynamic parameters, glutathione, catalase levels, nasopharyngeal body temperature, arterial blood gas changes, plasma cytokine levels (interleukin 1≤ and 6), biochemical parameters and intramucosal pH, length of stay in the intensive care unit, duration of mechanical ventilation support, and mortality. All measurements were made at baseline (15 min before alpha-tocopherol administration) and 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after alpha-tocopherol administration. Results: None of the parameters evaluated differed significantly between the two groups (p>0.05).

There were 10 children and 217 adult patients. Patients who underwent tracheotomy for upper airway obstruction were excluded. Results: The mean duration of intubation was 10.4 days (range 9 to 13 days). Early complications included hemorrhage (n=15, 6.6%) and subcutaneous emphysema (n=3, 1.3%), and late complications included laryngotracheal stenosis (n=2, 3.2%) and difficult decannulation (n=1, 1.6%).

Initial diagnoses were postobstructive pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotherapy in one patient, and lung carcinoma with persistent cough in the other.",
