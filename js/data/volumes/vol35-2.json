    "abstract": "Ductus venosus (DV) assessment gives valuable information under different fetal conditions. Fetal conditions that are affected by cardiovascular deterioration must be assessed with DV Doppler examination. This assessment not only assists in directing management but also helps to predict the perinatal outcome. Detailed evaluation of forward cardiac function using velocity ratios is used to clarify the underlying cardiovascular pathology. Abstract The ductus venosus is a fetal vessel that functions importantly in the transfer of oxygen-and nutrient-rich blood from the umbilical vein to vital organs. Its control under active regulation and its anatomy result in a flow-velocity profile that is typically forward throughout the cardiac cycle. This forward cardiac function reflects afterload, cardiac contractility, compliance, and vascular volume changes. Ductus venosus assessment gives valuable information under different fetal conditions. For example, during first trimester screening, an abnormal ductus venosus measurement changes the screening result. Assessment of ductus venosus in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome is an essential element of staging. In fetal growth restriction, an abnormal waveform mandates imminent delivery. In this review, we will discuss the role of ductus venosus assessment and its role in antenatal management and outcome prediction in certain fetal conditions throughout pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Transplantation of fetal mesencephalic tissue is a well-established concept for functional reinnervation of the dopamine-depleted rat striatum. However, there is no extensive description of the glial response of the host brain following this procedure.Aims: The present study aimed to quantitatively and qualitatively analyse astrogliosis surrounding intrastriatal grafts and compare it to the reaction to mechanical injury with the transplantation instrument only.Study Design: Animal experimentation.Methods: The standard 6-hydroxydopamine-induced unilateral model of Parkinson’s disease was used. The experimental animals received transplantation of a single-cell suspension of E14 ventral mesencephalic tissue. Control animals (sham-transplanted) were subjected to injury by the transplantation cannula, without injection of a cell suspension. Histological analyses were carried out 7 and 28 days following the procedure by immunohistochemistry assays for tyrosine hydroxylase and glial fibrillary acidic protein. To evaluate astrogliosis, the cell density and immunopositive area were measured in distinct zones within and surrounding the grafts or the cannula tract.Results: Statistical analysis revealed that astrogliosis in the grafted striatum increased from day 7 to day 28, as shown by a significant change in both cell density and the immunopositive area. The cell density increased from 816.7±370.6 to 1403±272.1 cells/mm2 (p<0.0001) аnd from 523±245.9 to 1164±304.8 cells/mm2 (p<0.0001) in the two zones in the graft core, and from 1151±218.6 to 1485±210.6 cells/mm2 (p<0.05) for the zone in the striatum immediately adjacent to the graft. The glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing area increased from 0.3109±0.1843 to 0.7949±0.1910 (p<0.0001) and from 0.1449±0.1240 to 0.702±0.2558 (p<0.0001) for the same zones in the graft core, and from 0.5277±0.1502 to 0.6969±0.1223 (p<0.0001) for the same area adjacent to the graft zone. However, astrogliosis caused by mechanical impact only (control) did not display such dynamics. This finding suggests an influence of the grafted cells on the host’s glia, possibly through cross-talk between astrocytes and transplanted neurons.Conclusion: This bidirectional relationship is affected by multiple factors beyond the mechanical trauma. Elucidation of these factors might help achieve better functional outcomes after intracerebral transplantation.",

Several pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods are available for managing this pain. Sterile water injection is considered as alternative method for nonpharmacological pain management. Aims: To assess the satisfaction level and effectiveness of sterile water injection for back pain among women in labour. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Methods: A total of 168 term, healthy women with labour pain and severe back pain were randomized into the sterile water injection (study) and dry injection (placebo) groups.

Results: The mean back pain scores at 30 min after injections were significantly lower in the study group (study group: 31.66±11.38; placebo: 75±18.26, p<0.01). The mean decrease in pain scores after 30 min according to baseline was significantly higher in the study group (study group: 54.82±7.81; placebo: 13.33±12.05, p<0.01). The need for epidural analgesia, time of delivery, mode of delivery, and Apgar and breastfeeding scores were similar in both groups. Maternal satisfaction from the analgesic effect was significantly higher in the study group (study group: 84.5%; placebo: 35.7%, p<0.01). Conclusion: The application of sterile water injection is effective for relieving back pain in the first stage of labour and has a sufficient satisfaction level among women.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most frequently occurring solid bone cancer with the second highest cancer-related mortality in pediatric patients. Even though epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 is known to be overexpressed in osteosarcoma and is associated with poor clinical outcome, few reports are available regarding its mechanism. Epidermal growth factor-like domain 7-knockdown U2OS cells inhibit the migration, adhesion, and angiogenesis of co-cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells by diminishing phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt signaling pathway activity and vascular endothelial growth factor expression Abstract Background: Even though epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 is known to be overexpressed in osteosarcoma and is associated with poor clinical outcome, few reports are available regarding its mechanism.Aims: The objective of this study was to explore the effect and mechanism of downregulating epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 expression in a human osteosarcoma cell line on the biological function of co-cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells.Study Design: Cell study.Methods: In the present study, human osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS, Saos-2, HOS, and MG63, and normal human osteoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1x antibiotics at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an incubator. Of the four osteosarcoma cell lines, U2OS expresses the highest level of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 mRNA as determined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. With the knockdown of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 in U2OS and human umbilical vein endothelial cells by lentivirus, the proliferation and apoptosis of U2OS and human umbilical vein endothelial cells were investigated using MTT and flow cytometry assays. After the co-culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and epidermal growth factor-like domain 7-knockdown U2OS, the in vitro effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, and the angiogenic ability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells were detected using MTT, flow cytometry, Transwell, and tube formation assays, respectively. The expressions of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phospho-Akt, total Akt, and vascular endothelial growth factor in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were detected using western blot assay.Results: Lentivirus with epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 shRNA could not significantly affect the proliferation and apoptosis of both U2OS and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, whereas the knockdown of epidermal growth factor-like domain 7 in U2OS could significantly inhibit the migration, adhesion, and angiogenic ability of co-cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In addition, the expressions of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phospho-Akt, and vascular endothelial growth factor in human umbilical vein endothelial cells decreased after co-culturing with epidermal growth factor-like domain 7-knockdown U2OS.Conclusion: Epidermal growth factor-like domain 7-knockdown U2OS cells inhibit the migration, adhesion, and angiogenesis of co-cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells by diminishing phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Akt signaling pathway activity and vascular endothelial growth factor expression.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Free radical damage is known to occur during liver regeneration. The Ginkgo biloba extract EGb761 has antioxidant properties due to its ability to scavenge free radicals. FK506 has been widely used as an immunosuppressant that stimulates hepatocyte proliferation following partial hepatectomy.Aims: To explore whether EGb761 enhances liver regeneration after hepatectomy in rats, we investigated the effects of EGb761 alone and in combination with FK506 on the liver regenerative process.Study Design: Animal experimentation.Methods: A total of 75 Wistar albino rats weighing 340.08±11.66 g were randomly divided into five experimental groups: sham, control, FK506, EGb761, and FK506 + EGb761. According to the study groups, rats were administered FK506 at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day and EGb761 at 25 mg/kg/day three times via the intraperitoneal route. Then, two-thirds hepatectomy was performed according to the Higgins and Anderson technique in all the rats. At postoperative 48 h, 53 surviving rats were sacrificed. Serum and plasma samples were collected for analyzing thymidine kinase and oxidative stress marker levels. The regenerated liver was entirely resected, weighed, and sectioned. The mitotic index was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin staining. The extent of liver regeneration was calculated using the Child’s formula. The data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA, with a significance level of 5% (p<0.05).Results: Rats who received EGb761 showed significantly higher levels of liver regeneration than those who received FK506 or FK506 + EGb761 (p<0.01). Thymidine kinase level and mitotic index were significantly higher in the EGb761 (p<0.005) and FK506 (p<0.05) groups than in the control and sham groups. In addition, the liver regeneration percentage was significantly higher in the EGb761 group than in the FK506 group (p<0.01). Myeloperoxidase and malondialdehyde levels were significantly correlated between the EGb761 and FK506 groups, even at lower levels in the EGb761 group (p<0.001).Conclusion: EGb761, which is an antioxidant, reduces liver damage and stimulates liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy in rats through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims: To investigate the epidemiology of Clostridium difficile infection in Romanian hospitals.Methods: A survey was conducted at nine hospitals throughout Romania between November 2013 and February 2014.Results: The survey identified 393 patients with Clostridium difficile infection. The median age was 67 years (range: 2-94 years); 56% of patients were aged >65 years. The mean prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection was 5.2 cases per 10.000 patient-days. The highest prevalences were 24.9 and 20 per 10.000 patient-days in hospitals specializing in gastroenterology and infectious diseases, respectively. Clostridium difficile infections were health care-associated in 70.5% patients and community-acquired in 10.2%. The origin was not determined in 19.3%. Clostridium difficile infection was severe in 12.3% of patients, and the in-hospital all-cause mortality was 8.8%. Polymerase chain reaction ribotype 027 had the highest prevalence in all participating hospitals and represented 82.6% of the total ribotyped isolates. The minimum inhibitory concentration of moxifloxacin was >4 μg/mL for 59 of 80 tested isolates (73.8%). Of 59 isolates, 54 were highly resistant to moxifloxacin (minimum inhibitory concentration ≥32 μg/mL), and the majority were polymerase chain reaction ribotype 027 (p<0.0001).Conclusion: The ribotype 027 was the predominant cause of Clostridium difficile infections in Romania. In some specialized hospitals, the prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection was higher than the European mean prevalence, and this demonstrates the need for strict adherence to infection control programs.",

Chest X-ray showed bilateral diffuse pneumonic consolidation and mild cardiomegaly. We detected stable ST depression by electrocardiography. Echocardiography showed normal systolic functions. Troponin-1 levels were high (66 mcg/dL, upper limit: 0.04 mcg/dL). Influenza A virus DNA was detected by the respiratory viral panel. After her successful treatment for acute pneumonia and myocarditis due to Influenza A virus, her syncope attacks persisted. Marked ST elevation was observed during exercise electrocardiography. Coronary angiography showed severe occlusions in the coronary arteries. High serum levels of total cholesterol (756 mg/dL) and low-density lipoprotein-C (556 mg/dL) were noticed.
