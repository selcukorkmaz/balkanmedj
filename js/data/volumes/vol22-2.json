    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Registries for the causes of death constitute one of the basic components of health system in all countries. The reliability of the notified causes of death appears to be a common problem. In this study, we compared the information on death certificates routinely sent from the Kocaeli University Hospital to the State Statistics Institute (SSI) with that found on patient records. Study Design: A retrospective review was made on patient records and death certificates sent to the SSI in 2002 and 2003. The causes of death were classified as principal, contributing, and immediate causes according to the WHO criteria. Diagnoses were defined according to the ICD-10 list. Results: Of 744 deaths, records of 665 cases were present in both sources. Certificates of 211 cases (31.7%) included the correct principal death cause, while in 162 cases (24.4%) the deaths were attributed to other disease/conditions such as cardiorespiratory arrest, and in 112 cases, (16.8%), to an immediate cause. An irrelevant cause was found in 105 (15.8%) certificates. We detected a number of mistakes in 210 certificates, the most common being the use of inappropriate abbreviation (59.0%) and disease terms not available in the disease list (34.3%). Conclusion: The accuracy of death certificates may be improved with training programs among physicians. Furthermore, postmortem autopsy examinations are very important to determine the exact cause of death.",

Study Design: Forty ASA I-II patients at the age of 65 years or above, who were planned for elective urological or gynecological operation were randomized to two groups equal in number. Each group received 0.06 mgkg-1 intramuscular midazolam for premedication, and intravenous 1.5 mgkg-1 propofol, 0.6 mgkg-1 atracurium besylate, and 500 µg alfentanil for induction. Anesthesia was maintained with approximately 1 MAC isoflurane in group I, and 1 MAC sevoflurane in group II, and, when necessary, intravenous 0.1 mgkg-1 atracurium. Recovery criteria included spontaneous eye opening, extubation, verbal response, and orientation times at the end of operation. Results: Compared to the isoflurane group, durations of spontaneous eye opening (p=0.0002), extubation (p=0.0002), verbal response (p=0.0001), and orientation (p=0.0001) were significantly shorter in the sevoflurane group.

Results: After the treatment, statistically significant improvements were achieved in active and passive flexion, abduction, external and internal rotation; however, the numeric decrease in subluxation was not statistically significant.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: We investigated blood erythrocyte arginase activity in lung cancer patients and the effect of cell type and extrapulmonary metastasis on this activity. Patients and Methods: The study included 46 lung cancer patients (mean age 63.1 years) and 29 healthy subjects (mean age 57.2 years). Erythrocyte arginase activity was determined with the use of the Geyer-Dabich method. Erythrocyte arginase activity was compared between patients with small cell lung cancer (n=15), non-small cell lung cancer (n=31), extrapulmonary metastases (n=23), and no metastasis (n=23). Results: Compared to healthy controls, erythrocyte arginase activity was significantly increased in all lung cancer patients (p<0.01), and in patient groups with small cell lung cancer (p<0.05), non-small cell lung cancer (p<0.01), extrapulmonary metastases (p<0.01), and no metastasis (p<0.01). On the other hand, erythrocyte arginase activity did not differ significantly between patients with small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, and between patients with and without extrapulmonary metastases. Conclusion: Our data suggest that, compared to healthy subjects, erythrocyte arginase activity is significantly increased in lung cancer patients, with no additional effect of cell type or extrapulmonary metastases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalences of pediculus humanis capitis and tinea capitis and the causative agents of tinea capitis in elementary school children in Edirne. Materials and Methods: A total of 12,868 students from 34 elementary schools were scanned in April and May 2003. Samples of skin scrapings and hair roots were collected from students with hair and scalp lesions. Specimens were evaluated microscopically by KOH, and were inoculated into agar slants of Sabouraud dextrose agar with cycloheximide. Results: Eggs, nits or adult forms of head lice were detected in 698 (5.4%) students. The prevalence of head lice was significantly higher in girls (10.3%) than in boys (0.9%) (p<0.001). The infestation rate was the lowest below seven years of age (3.4%, p<0.001). Infestation rate was also high in families with low socioeconomic conditions (p<0.001). Tinea capitis was not detected in any of the students. Conclusion: Pediculus humanis capitis was found to continue to be a public health problem in Edirne. The following conclusions were drawn for its eradication: periodic scanning of the students by families, teachers, and health professionals should be implemented; affected children should be properly treated; health facilities should be improved; and continuous education should be given to prevent its spread.",
