The disease stems from pathogenic variants in the MEFV gene causing dysregulated innate immune responses and persistent hyperinflammation. Emerging research suggests epigenetic mechanisms—including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA regulation—may influence phenotypic variability, disease severity, and treatment response.",

    "abstract": "Depression and hearing loss commonly occur in the aging population and may arise from shared mechanisms. Adults aged 55 and older from three nationally representative study cohorts were included: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the Health and Retirement Study, and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Cross-sectional analyses revealed that depression was significantly associated with higher pure-tone average thresholds. In pooled longitudinal analyses of 6,956 participants, individuals with baseline depression exhibited a higher incidence of hearing loss. Increasing (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09-2.21) and fluctuating (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.12-1.39) depressive symptom trajectories were independent predictors of hearing loss, whereas decreasing trajectories indicated no significant association.",

The relationship between the hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) and delirium in sepsis patients is not yet clearly established. This retrospective cohort analysis of 3,744 sepsis patients employed logistic regression, Cox proportional hazard models, and restricted cubic spline analyses. Delirium risk in the lowest HGI group was 67.7% higher than in the middle tertile. A U-shaped relationship emerged between HGI and delirium occurrence, with an inflection point at HGI = -0.34, positioning HGI as a potential prognostic biomarker.",
