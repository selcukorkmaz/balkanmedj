The kidney was most commonly affected (68.5%), followed by the adrenal gland (9.2%), ovary (7.3%), and uterus (3.4%). Radiological imaging, especially ultrasonography, was the primary diagnostic method. Notably, 134 of 155 surgical patients were initially misdiagnosed with either malignant or benign tumors.",
