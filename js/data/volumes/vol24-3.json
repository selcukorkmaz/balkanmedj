For this aim, methods and the results of almost all published studies on cartilage tympanoplasty techniques with palisades, stripes and slices were analyzed. Design: Out of the 23 well-defined cartilage tympanoplasty methods, classified in six groups, the clinical research in the oldest group, consisting of six different methods with palisades, stripes and slices, will be described and analyzed. Patients and Methods: The six tympanoplasty methods with cartilage –(i) the underlay palisade method of Heermann, (ii) the on-lay palisade method, (iii) the method of broad palisades, (iv) the method of underlay stripes, (v) the method of on-lay stripes, (vi) the Dornhoffer mosaic cartilage tympanoplasty– are briefly described and illustrated. All published anatomical and functional results of surgery, achieved with each of the six methods, are described and analyzed. Results: The clinical research on cartilage tympanoplasty with palisades, stripes and slices have been very scanty. The anatomical results are good and there have been few re-operations after cartilage tympanoplasty. Conclusion: New clinical studies on cartilage tympanoplasty should be started and some of the proposed methods of comparison can be used.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The characteristic features of exclusively breast-fed infants with hypernatremic dehydration in our neonatal intensive care unit were evaluated. Patients and Methods: Within the last two years, fourteen exclusively breast-fed newborn infants (10 females, 4 males; mean gestational age 38±1.7; range 34 to 40 weeks) whose serum sodium level was equal to or greater than 150 mEq/L with signs of dehydration were evaluated from clinical charts retrospectively. Results: 71% of all cases were girls. Mean birth weight was 3020±715 gr. 93% of the cases were AGA and 78.6% were first child of the family. Mean age of mothers was 28±5.4 years. 57% of the cases were born by cesarean and 57% were referred to our hospital from different hospitals. The most common presenting complaint was fever and refusing sucking; and mean application time was 5.5±4.6 days. On the admission, mean weight loss was 14.5±9.1%, serum sodium level 158.5±14 mEq/L, serum urea level 73±109 mg/dl, serum creatinine level 1.2±2.1 mg/dl, and serum osmolarity 338±35 mOsmol/L.

The causes of this food poisoning were investigated in this study. Patients and Methods: Patients had symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, weakness, fever, nausea and vomiting. Cultures for bacteria were obtained from the food and patients. Microbiologic and epidemiologic study was performed. Results: Salmonella typhimurium (n=18) and Shigella dysenteria (n=25) were isolated in the samples obtained from the cases, but bacteria weren't isolated from food samples. Conclusion: The food poisoning occured most likely as a result of contamination of water containers in which the food was washed. Food products should be washed in fresh and clean water to prevent further poisoning incidents.",

Simulations were performed in SAS 9.0 by using Monte Carlo simulation method. Analyses were made with SAS GENMOD procedure. Results: When intraclass correlation coefficient was low (ICC<0.10), there was no significant difference in parameter estimation and their biases and it was observed that GEE gave reliable, consistent and unbiased estimations. However, when ICC increased (ICC>0.10), it was found that the parameter estimations were significantly biased.

Regional lymph-node dissection was performed together with surgical excision on patients with palpabl lymph nodes (stages III and IV) detected during preoperative examination. Descriptive characteristics such as anatomical locations, histological subtypes and stages of the CMM were examined; the tumor size and thickness, adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy rates, local recurrence rates were evaluated. Results: Palpabl lymph nodes were identified in 74% (n=41) of the patients. Lymph-node dissection was performed together with surgical excision on these patients. The average tumor thickness and tumor size were 2.1±1.3 mm and 21.7±11.6 mm respectively.

A 29-year-old female presented with weight gain, hypertension and hirsutismus. Examinations revealed hypercortisolemia. Computed tomography revealed a solid mass 2.5-3 cm in size in the left surrenal gland and adrenalectomy was done. The diagnosis was adrenal cortical adenoma.
