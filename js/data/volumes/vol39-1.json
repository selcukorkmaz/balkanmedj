Specimens from operated patients were reassessed separately as peritumoral and intratumoral areas for tissue resident memory cells and tumor microenvironmental elements (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, tumor stroma, CD204+ macrophages, PDL1+ immune cells). Disease-free survival and overall survival were defined from the date of operation to the date of recurrence and the date of first diagnosis to the date of death, respectively. If the patient was alive, the last visit date was taken into account.Results: The median age at diagnosis was 63 (range: 40-78). The median follow-up period was 18.9 months (range: 1.4-80.4 months). Median overall survival was 23.7 months (1.4-80.4 months) and median disease-free survival was 10.8 months (1.4-74.4 months).Patients with higher intra-tumoral tissue-resident memory cell counts had a longer survival trend than those having lower values (25.6 months vs. 18 months, respectively, P = .84). According to microenvironmental evaluations, lower stromal score (defined as stroma having less desmoplasia and rich in cells) and presence of peritumoral Crohn’s-like inflammatory response were associated with higher survival (29.2 months vs. 19.7 months for low vs. high stromal scores, respectively, P = .16 and 30.2 months vs. 18.1 months for the presence of Crohn’s-like inflammatory response P = .13). Decreased survival was observed in tumors with increased CD204+ tumor-associated macrophages which were immunosuppressive elements of the microenvironment (12 months vs. 26.3 months for intra-tumoral assessment, P = .29).Conclusion: Tissue-resident memory T cells and other microenvironmental features may be prognostic in resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.

HER2 next-­generation sequencing amplified tumors were investigated for HER2 expression and amplification using immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization.Results: From a group of 256 non-small cell lung carcinoma, 33 tumors (12.8%) showed HER2 amplification with next-generation sequencing. Although we observed more frequent HER2 positivity by immunohistochemistry in next-generation sequencing-amplified cases, when compared to non-amplified cases (50% and 23% respectively), the difference was not significant (P = .221). Within the HER2 amplified group, inter-method-agreement was very good between next-­generation sequencing results amplification and in situ hybridization status. Next-generation sequencing results showed a strong interclass correlation coefficient with HER2/cell (P = .009, r = 0.777) and HER2/CEP17 ratio (P = .001, r = 0.805). The median HER2/CEP17 ratio was higher in the next-generation sequencing amplified group (P = .013); however, three cases were found to be amplified by silver in situ hybridization among the next-­generation sequencing non-amplified cases. EGFR and FGFR1 amplification were more frequent in HER2 next-generation sequencing amplified group than next-generation sequencing non-amplified group (P < .001).Conclusion: Until the effects of HER2 amplification on the HER2 ­protein are well understood and pulmonary carcinoma algorithms are defined, non-small cell lung carcinomas found to be amplified by next-generation sequencing should be verified by additional methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Widespread and effective use of molecular diagnostic tests is indispensable for protecting public health and containing the severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. More than 1 year into the pandemic, as resources have reached a point of depletion, grouping samples in pools of certain sizes appears to be a reasonable method to reduce both the costs and the processing time without necessitating additional training, equipment, or materials.Aims: To assess whether the pooling strategy that was used in past outbreaks and is used in blood tests prior to transfusion for screening large populations can also be used in SARS CoV-2 tests.Study Design: Diagnostic accuracy study.Methods: This prospective study was conducted with 2815 samples, sent to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) Laboratory of our hospital between February 12 and 21, 2021, to be tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. The samples were examined individually and in pools of five 100 µl taken from each sequential sample, using 3 different SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits, the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit (Seegene, Republic of Korea), the GeneMAP™ 2019-nCoV detection V.3 kit (GenMark, Türkiye), and the Bio-Speedy™ SARS-CoV-2 Double Gene™ RT-qPCR kit (Bioeksen, Türkiye) on the BioRAD CFX96™ Touch (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) platform available in our laboratory.Results: Following the extraction of serial dilutions prepared from the SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive (cycle of threshold: 20) sample, the standard curves of RT-PCR were analyzed. By evaluating the efficiency (E) values, all 3 kits showed high sensitivity and similar results; while the highest level was detected with the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit in the nucleocapsid (N) gene (E: 124%), the lowest was detected with the Double Gene™ RT-qPCR kit in the N and ORF 1ab genes (E: 90%). Of the samples included in the study, only 1 positive sample with low viral load was found to be negative when studied by pooling. The total number of kits to be used in pooled tests and then to individually retest the 5 samples in positive pools was calculated as 827 and the savings rate as 69.91% (1968/2815).Conclusion: The pooling strategy is an effective approach to extend the impact of limited testing resources and reagents available in certain periods of the COVID-19 pandemic. Testing by pooling samples requires improvement of RNA extraction methods and careful monitoring of RT-PCR test sensitivity to avoid missing low-positive entities. Therefore, based on the prevalence of COVID-19 in their regions, laboratories should conduct their own validation of pooling studies for RNA extraction and amplification methods they use.",
