    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Young, non-obese adults are considered at low risk for cardiometabolic diseases, although markers of an unhealthy metabolic state are not uncommon findings in this population. Adipose tissue dysfunction, evaluated by the adipokine profile, significantly influences lipid and glucose metabolism and low-grade systemic inflammation.Aims: To determine the relation between adipose tissue dysfunction and the already confirmed cardiometabolic risk indicators, including the atherogenic index of plasma, lipid accumulation product, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and the low-grade inflammation markers, namely, interleukin 6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Study Design: Cross-sectional study.Methods: We recruited 93 non-obese, healthy young adults. Anthropometric, lipid profile, inflammatory markers, and adipokines were measured. An abnormal adipokine profile (high leptin-to-adiponectin ratio) was considered as a marker of a dysfunctional adipose tissue. The correlation between the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio and the anthropometric measurements, atherogenic index of plasma, lipid accumulation product, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, interleukin 6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was determined. Results: We found a direct correlation between the abnormal adipokine profile and the cardiometabolic risk indicators mentioned above, except for the low-grade inflammatory markers. In the regression model derived from our data, the leptin-to-adiponectin ratio was best correlated with the unfavorable plasma lipid profile, as estimated by the atherogenic index of plasma (r=0.097, confidence interval=0.015-0.180, p=0.021). A significantly higher leptin-to-adiponectin ratio was found in the insulin-resistant group (p=0.012) and in the highest lipid accumulation product quartile (p=0.032).Conclusion: In a non-obese young population, the high rate of leptin-adiponectin may be a good predictor of cardiovascular and metabolic risk assessment.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Background: It is well known that axonal degeneration plays a role in disability in patients with multiple sclerosis, and synaptopathy has recently become an important issue.Aims: To investigate the possible roles of selected synaptic and presynaptic membrane protein genetic polymorphisms (VAMP2, SNAP-25, synaptotagmin, and syntaxin 1A) in patients with multiple sclerosis.Study Design: Case-control study.Methods: A total of 123 patients with multiple sclerosis and 192 healthy controls were included.

Aims: To show the programmed death-ligand-1 expression status in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma and its effect on the prognosis and the relationship with clinicopathologic data. Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.Methods: The study included 208 cases who were diagnosed with NSCLC and who underwent surgical resection between 2001 and 2012. Programmed death-ligand-1 (SP142 clone) was applied to the histological sections acquired from the microarray paraffin blocks with immunohistochemistry. Staining intensity was scored as weak (+, 1), moderate (++, 2), and strong (+++, 3). Percentage (0%-100%) was multiplied by staining intensity (1-2-3) to calculate the H score. Four different cut-off values were used; 1: ≥1% (independent of intensity), 2: ≥5% (independent of intensity), 3: ≥5% moderate/strong staining (except for weak staining), 4: H score ≥30 values were considered positive. In this study, staining a single cell at any intensity was considered positive. Results: Thirty-four out 208 cases (16.3%) had PDL-1 positive staining. PDL-1 expression was observed in patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma independent of the histological type or subtype (range; 0-25%). When the cut-off level was set to ≥5% with moderate and strong staining, the median overall survival was 45 months for the PD-L1 positive group and not reached for the PD-L1 negative group (p-value 0.024). PD-L1 positivity was significantly higher in patients over the age of 60 years and in cases with a tumor diameter of more than 5 cm (p=0.023 and 0.025, respectively).Conclusion: PD-L1 expression is positive in 16.3% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and may have a negative prognostic value.",
