While the effect of the technique of regional analgesia on complication rates has been considered in some studies, this issue remains controversial.Aims: To determine the effect of caudal block and penile block on complication rates of hypospadias repair in patients with subcoronal hypospadias.Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.Methods: Data of children who underwent hypospadias repair between 2011 and 2019 in our clinic (n = 770) were reviewed retrospectively. Only patients with subcoronal hypospadias and who underwent tubularized incised plate urethroplasty, performed by the same two experienced surgeons (n = 279), were included in the study. The exclusion criteria were incomplete data and follow-up time shorter than 12 months. Data of 279 patients were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the analgesia type: caudal block (n = 95) and penile block (n = 184), and complication rates were compared between these groups.Results: The median age was 36 months in the caudal block group and 30 months in the penile block group (P = 0.390). The median follow-up times were 54 and 42.7 months in the caudal and penile block groups, respectively. Total complication rates did not differ significantly between the groups and were determined as 10.5% and 12.5% in the caudal and penile groups, respectively.

In the second phase, the blood samples were collected from 74 MPM patients who had received chemotherapy when the best overall response and disease recurrence were determined. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was undertaken to detect the miRNA expression levels. The miRNA expression profiles of MPM patients were compared with those of HDs. The associations between the expression levels of miRNAs and prognosis and response to treatment were then evaluated.Results: All miRNAs, except miR-31-5p, were expressed differently in MPM relative to that in HDs.

    "abstract": "Background: Heart failure (HF) is considered a significant public health issue with a substantial and growing epidemiologic and economic burden in relation to longer life expectancy and aging global populationAims: To determine cost-of-disease of heart failure (HF) in Turkey from the payer perspective.Study Design: Cross-sectional cost of disease study.Methods: In this cost-of-disease study, annual direct and indirect costs of management of HF were determined based on epidemiological, clinical and lost productivity inputs provided by a Delphi panel consisted of 11 experts in HF with respect to ejection fraction (EF) status (HF patients with reduced EF (HFrEF), mid-range EF (HFmrEF) and preserved EF (HFpEF)) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification. Direct medical costs included cost items on outpatient management, inpatient management, medications, and non-pharmaceutical treatments. Indirect cost was calculated based on the lost productivity due to absenteeism and presenteeism.Results: 51.4%, 19.5%, and 29.1% of the patients were estimated to be HFrEF, HFmrEF, and HFpEF patients, respectively. The total annual direct medical cost per patient was $887 and non-pharmaceutical treatments ($373, 42.1%) were the major direct cost driver. Since an estimated nationwide number of HF patients is 1,128,000 in 2021, the total annual national economic burden of HF is estimated to be $1 billion in 2021.

    "abstract": "To the Editor, Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is critical in kidney transplant recipients due to the risk of developing severe form of the disease. Although the effect of vaccines on the transplant population is few in previous publications, widespread vaccination continues to be applied.1 However, these patients experience adverse events due to vaccination.2 Although transient neutropenia is a known side effect of two SARS-CoV-2 vaccines3, neutropenia associated with inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac® by Sinovac®) has not clearly been elucidated. We, therefore, report the case of a kidney transplant recipient who presented with neutropenia after the second dose of the inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. A 60-year-old female kidney transplant recipient was admitted to the transplant clinic at a routine follow-up visit on the second day after receiving the second dose of CoronaVac®. She underwent deceased donor kidney transplantation four years ago due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The posttransplant course was insignificant for four years. The immunosuppressive regimen included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone. The patient had no complaint, and physical examination was unremarkable. Complete blood count demonstrated white blood cell: 2,700/mm3, neutrophil: 600/mm3, lymphocyte: 1400/mm3, hemoglobin: 15 g/dl, and thrombocyte: 202,000/mm3. Biochemical investigations include serum creatinine: 0.9 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase: 150 U/L, C-reactive protein: 2 mg/dl, folate: 13 μg/L, Vitamin B12: 500 pg/ml, ferritin: 100 ng/ml, transferrin saturation: 23%, and tacrolimus level: 6 ng/ml. Mycophenolate mofetil was halted. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests were negative for Cytomegalovirus, Parvovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and SARS-CoV-2. PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were repeated thrice at 48-h intervals. Peripheral blood smear did not reveal atypical cells. A bone marrow biopsy revealed a normocellular marrow with the hyperplastic granulocytic cell line. No signs of dysplasia were detected. Neutropenia resolved spontaneously at the end of two months, and mycophenolate mofetil was reinstated in the immunosuppressive regimen. Currently, the patient is followed up in a good clinical condition. Neutropenia is a common problem in kidney transplant recipients occurring in 10%-30% of such patients. The etiology of neutropenia is often multifactorial and includes drugs, bacterial infections, viral infections, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases.4 It usually occurs at the third month following transplantation. Moreover, prolonged neutropenia predisposes to infections and causes allograft rejections.4 Transient neutropenia after the administration of several vaccines have been reported.5 However, according to a recent report by Sing et al.6, CoronaVac vaccine did not increase the risk of neutropenia. Although the sample for this study was large, immunosuppressed patients with organ transplants were excluded. The concomitant use of mycophenolic acid derivatives or azathioprine predisposes to the occurrence of neutropenia in transplanted patients after vaccine administration. In our case, we detected neutropenia in a regular transplant visit. Bacterial and viral infections were excluded through clinical and serological findings. Moreover, the causative drug was stopped. However, neutropenia persisted, and a bone marrow biopsy was performed to rule out a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder. After excluding all other etiologies, neutropenia was linked to CoronaVac®. Transient neutropenia is an adverse event that occurs in the first two weeks after administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Postvaccination neutropenia is not associated with secondary infections and does not diminish the immunologic response to vaccination. However, neutropenia is a surrogate marker for vaccine response in patients with hematological malignancies.7 In conclusion, kidney transplant recipients must be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, though neutropenia could occur in some patients. Clinicians should follow-up these patients with blood counts after excluding other causes such as infections, drugs, and malignancies.

Although the effect of vaccines on the transplant population is few in previous publications, widespread vaccination continues to be applied.1 However, these patients experience adverse events due to vaccination.2 Although transient neutropenia is a known side effect of two SARS-CoV-2 vaccines3, neutropenia associated with inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (CoronaVac® by Sinovac®) has not clearly been elucidated. We, therefore, report the case of a kidney transplant recipient who presented with neutropenia after the second dose of the inactivated whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. A 60-year-old female kidney transplant recipient was admitted to the transplant clinic at a routine follow-up visit on the second day after receiving the second dose of CoronaVac®.
