    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are significantly influenced by apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress.Aims: To investigate the effects of quercetin on ER stress-mediated apoptosis in a trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced experimental IBD model.Study Design: In vivo animal experimental study.Methods: To demonstrate the effect of quercetin in an experimental colitis model, Control, TNBS, and TNBS+quercetin groups were created with 24 Wistar Albino rats. Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of 25 mg TNBS. In the TNBS+quercetin group, intragastrically 100 mg/kg quercetin was given for 7 days, immediately after colitis induction. In the TNBS-induced experimental IBD model, we evaluated the effects of quercetin on colonic epithelial cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, ER stress, the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and the nuclear factor kappa B immunoreactivities, the levels of myeloperoxidase and tumor necrosis factor-α, the disease activity index with colonic histopathologic changes.Results: TNBS administration induced an elevated level of disease activity and oxidative stress indices, inflammation markers, and an increase in the immunoreactivities of nuclear factor kappa B and the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase in the colon of the colitis group. Glucose regulatory protein 78, caspase-12 immunoreactivities, and epithelial cell apoptosis also were shown in the colon. However, quercetin improved TNBS-induced histopathological alterations, apoptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and ER stress.Conclusion: This study suggests that quercetin has a regulatory effect on ER stress-mediated apoptosis, and thus may be beneficial in treating IBD.",

The International Classification of Diseases-10 (ICD-10) codes were used to identify adults with HF (n = 2,701,099) and associated comorbidities. Türkiye is divided into seven geographically distinct regions. Epidemiological characteristics and survival data of these regions were analyzed separately. All-cause mortality was set as the primary outcome.Results: In , the total estimated prevalence of adult patients with HF is 2.939%, ranging from 2.442% in Southeastern Anatolia to 4.382% in the Black Sea Region. Except for the Eastern Anatolia Region, the three most often reported comorbidities were hypertension, dyslipidemia, and anxiety disorders. The rates of prescribing guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for HF and other medications varied significantly.
