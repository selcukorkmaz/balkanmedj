Study Design: The study included Medicine Faculty students of Trakya University, who received education between 1987 and 1995, during which two different education systems, namely an integrated system and the classical system were implemented between 1987-1992 and 1993-1995, respectively. The place of our faculty was found according to the average Clinical Medicine and Basic Medicine scores of the graduates in the first TUS following their graduation and a comparison was made between the two systems. The effect of different education systems were assessed on the TUS scores. Results: Compared to the ÖYS placement, the students who were enroled in the integrated system obtained higher TUS scores in only three out of 12 examinations. However, TUS scores were higher than those of OYS placement in five out of six examinations in the students who received the classical system. Conclusion: The results show that the classical education system is associated with higher success rates in TUS scores.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Eucalyptus belongs to the Myrtles family and its homeland is Australia and Tazmania. It is very easy to grow this tree, and some species can reach heights over 60-70 meters. As its roots widely spread, large quantities of water can be absorbed, which is of great help in drying swaps, particularly in malaria-struck countries; hence the name, malaria tree. In addition, eucalyptus oil together with menthol is used as an ingredient of pastilles to relieve cold-related complaints. Eucalyptus was first imported from Europe to Turkey during the Ottoman empire. Attempts were made to grow this tree for the drying of swaps and prevention of malaria in Edirne, where malaria had been a serious problem. People were enlightened about the benefits of Eucalyptus via articles published in an official newspaper of the city.",
