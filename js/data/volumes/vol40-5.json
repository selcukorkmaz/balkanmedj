Studies have shown conflicting results regarding statins ability to reduce the incidence of VTE.Aims: To perform a network meta-analysis to determine which lipid-lowering agent was more efficacious in and had more evidence regarding reducing the VTE risk.Study Design: Network meta-analysis of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs).Methods: RCTs that assessed the effectiveness and safety of statins or fibrates and compared them to a placebo or another statin were eligible for the study. The outcomes examined in the study were deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and/or VTE. We conducted a comprehensive search of the Medline database from 1966 to February 2017, using specific search terms related to VTE and statins. Additionally, we screened, and cross-checked relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We performed a network meta-analysis to compare the different lipid-lowering agents to each other and the placebo and their effectiveness.Results: Twenty-seven RCTs were included in the network meta-analysis (n = 137,940).

Rosuvastatin had the most favorable effect in reducing VTE risk than the other statins, fenofibrate, and placebo. Fenofibrate was ranked the worst drug choice, because it increased risk of VTE when compared with the other statins.

According to recent studies in cardiology, it has been suggested that spermidine (SPD) has cardioprotective properties.Aims: To explore the role and mechanism of SPD in alleviating myocardial fibrosis of DCM.Study Design: In vivo and in vitro study.Methods: Type 2 diabetic mice and primary neonatal mouse cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were selected. Measurements of serum-related markers, echocardiographic analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to evaluate myocardial fibrosis injury and the effects of SPD. The proliferation and migration of CFs undergoing different treatments were studied. Immunoblotting and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were used to demonstrate molecular mechanisms.Results: In vivo immunoblotting analysis indicated a downregulation of ornithine decarboxylase and an upregulation of SPD/spermine N1-acetyltransferase. We observed cardiac dysfunction in diabetic mice after 12 weeks. However, the administration of exogenous SPD improved cardiac function, decreased collagen deposition, and reduced myocardial tissue damage. mRNA expression levels of NLRP3, Caspase-1, GSDMD-N, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17A, and IL-18 were increased and suppressed in the myocardium of db/db mice upon treatment with SPD. SPD inhibited the proliferation, migration, and collagen secretion of high-glucose-treated fibroblasts in vitro. SPD inhibits the activation of the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway and decreases collagen deposition by reducing pyroptosis and Smad-7 ubiquitination levels.Conclusion: Based on our findings, SPD may have potential applications in protecting against the deterioration of cardiac function in patients with DCM due to a significant new mechanism for diabetic myocardial fibrosis that we discovered.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The study of ROS1 rearrangement in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) has gained importance as it enables personalized treatment of NSCLC with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Therefore, it is important that the ROS1 assessment tests become more standardized. In this study, we compared the two immunohistochemistry (IHC) antibodies (D4D6 and SP384 clones) and consistency with the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results in NSCLC.Aims: To investigate the effectiveness of the commonly used two IHC antibodies (SP384 and D4D6 clones) to detect ROS1 rearrangement in NSCLC.Study Design: A retrospective cohort study.Methods: The study included 103 samples diagnosed with NSCLC, confirmed using IHC and FISH ROS1 results (14 positives, four discordant, and 85 consecutive negatives), with sufficient tissue samples (≥ 50 tumor cells). All samples were initially tested with ROS1-IHC antibodies (D4D6 and SP384 clones); their ROS1 status was then analyzed using the FISH method. Finally, samples with discordant IHC and FISH results were confirmed using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction method.Results: The sensitivity of SP384 and D4D6 clones of ROS1 antibody was 100% with a ≥ 1 + cut-off. When the ≥ 2 + cut-off was used, the sensitivity rate for the SP384 clone was 100%, whereas the sensitivity for the D4D6 clone was 42.86%. ROS1 FISH rearranged samples were positive for both clones, but SP384 had generally higher intensity than D4D6. The mean IHC score was + 2 for SP384 and + 1.17 for D4D6. SP384 mostly tended to have a higher IHC score intensity, which made the evaluation easier than D4D6. SP384 has a higher sensitivity than D4D6. However, false positives were found in both clones. There was no significant correlation between ROS1 FISH-positivity percentage with SP384 (p = 0.713, ρ = 0.108) and D4D6 (p = 0.26, ρ = -0.323) IHC staining intensity. The staining patterns of both clones were similar (homogeneity/heterogeneity).Conclusion: Our findings show that the SP384 clone is more sensitive than D4D6. However, SP384 can also cause false positive results like D4D6. Knowing the variable diagnostic performance of different ROS1 antibodies before using them in clinical applications is necessary. IHC-positive results should be confirmed using FISH.",

Among the HLA class II alleles, the following alelles were the most frequently observed: for HLA-DRB1, DRB1*11, DRB1*04, and DRB1*13; for HLA-DQB1, DQB1*03, DQB1*05, and DQB1*06; and for HLA- DPB1, DPB1*04, DPB1*02, and DPB1*03. The most common alleles among HLA-DPB1 in the 4-digit evaluation were DPB1*04:01, DPB1*02:01, and DPB1*04:02. Among the HLA classes I and II, the following were the most frequently observed 8-digit alleles in HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1 and -DPB1 were A*02:01:01:01, B*49:01:01:01, C*04:01:01:06, DRB1*07:01:01:01, DQB1*03:01:01:02, and DPB1*02:01:02:05, respectively. The most common 6 loci haplotype was A*02~B*35~C*04~DRB1*11~DQB1*03~DPB1*04 (2.71%).Conclusion: In this study, low and high resolution HLA-DPB1 allele frequency, 6 locus haplotype frequency and genotype frequency were reported for the first time in Turkish population. These new data can be used to map HLA in our country and may provide ideas for potential future studies.",
