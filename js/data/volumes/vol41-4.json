Some studies found that women who experienced PROM had significantly lower vitamin C blood levels than those who did not, while others found no significant differences. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the efficacy of vitamin C in the prevention of PROM had conflicting results.Aims: Conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine if there was a significant difference in vitamin C blood levels in women who had PROM versus the control group who did not and to determine if vitamin C supplements could help prevent it.Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods: We registered our protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42022371644). We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus through February 15, 2024. Additionally, backward and forward citation searches were conducted. Studies were selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-Essentials: Workbooks for Meta-Analysis (version 1.5) was used for analysis.Results: Twenty-five studies (26 reports) met all eligibility criteria, with 18 studies (18 reports) assessing vitamin C levels and seven studies (eight reports) evaluating efficacy. Women with PROM, whether preterm or term, had significantly lower vitamin C levels [Hedges’ g, -1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.82, -0.14; p = 0.020; I2 = 94.08%) and specifically preterm PROM after removing the outlying study [Hedges’ g, -1.29; 95% CI: -1.85, -0.73; p < 0.001; I2 = 87.35%). Vitamin C supplementation significantly reduced the risk of preterm or term PROM [risk ratio (RR), 0.57; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.81; p < 0.001; I2 = 12.17%), particularly for preterm PROM (RR, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.99; p = 0.001; I2 = 0.00%). There were no significant differences in vitamin C levels between women with term PROM and controls, and there were no differences in the risk of developing term PROM between women taking vitamin C supplements and controls. Results were not robust in all sensitivity analyses.Conclusion: Women with PROM, particularly those who developed it preterm, appear to have significantly lower vitamin C levels, and vitamin C supplementation appears to be effective in reducing the risk of PROM, particularly preterm PROM. More high-quality studies with low risk of bias, more homogenous, and larger samples are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Optic neuritis, myelitis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) have been associated with antibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-immunoglobulin G (anti-MOG-IgG). Furthermore, patients with radiological and demographic features atypical for multiple sclerosis (MS) with optic neuritis and myelitis also demonstrate antibodies against aquaporin-4 and anti-MOG-IgG. However, data on the diagnosis, treatment, follow-up, and prognosis in patients with anti-MOG-IgG are limited.Aims: To evaluate the clinical, radiological, and demographic characteristics of patients with anti-MOG-IgG.Study Design: Multicenter, retrospective, observational study.Methods: Patients with blood samples demonstrating anti-MOG-IgG that had been evaluated at the Neuroimmunology laboratory at Ondokuz Mayıs University’s Faculty of Medicine were included in the study.Results: Of the 104 patients with anti-MOG-IgG, 56.7% were women and 43.3% were men. Approximately 2.4% of the patients were diagnosed with MS, 15.8% with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), 39.4% with NMOSD, 31.3% with isolated optic neuritis, and 11.1% with isolated myelitis. Approximately 53.1% of patients with spinal involvement at clinical onset demonstrated a clinical course of NMOSD. Thereafter, 8.8% of these patients demonstrated a clinical course similar to MS and ADEM, and 28.1% demonstrated a clinical course of isolated myelitis. The response to acute attack treatment was lower and the disability was higher in patients aged > 40 years than patients aged < 40 years at clinical onset. Oligoclonal band was detected in 15.5% of the patients.Conclusion: For patients with NMOSD and without anti-NMO antibodies, the diagnosis is supported by the presence of anti-MOG-IgG. Furthermore, advanced age at clinical onset, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at clinical onset, spinal cord involvement, and number of attacks may be negative prognostic factors in patients with anti-MOG-IgG.",

Descriptive statistics, Pearson’s chi-squared test, and Student’s t-test were performed to analyze the data using GraphPad Prism (version 9.4.1; Dotmatics, Boston, Massachusetts, USA).Results: The average distance from the proposed landmark to the RLN was 2.3 ± 0.85 mm. The RLN was located just posterior to the reference point in 95.31% of the cadavers. The RLN passed under the inferior constrictor muscle in 90.63% of the cadavers.
