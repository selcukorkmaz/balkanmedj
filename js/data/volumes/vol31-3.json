However, the aetiology of severe gastroenteritis leading to hospitalization in adults frequently remains unclear. Aims: Our objective was to study the epidemiology and causes of community-acquired, acute gastroenteritis in adult patients presenting to hospital. Study Design: Cross sectional study. Methods: A prospective study was conducted from January 2010 to January 2012, among patients ≥15 years old with community-acquired gastroenteritis presenting to the emergency room of the University Hospital “Mother Theresa” in Tirana, Albania. Stool samples and rectal swabs were collected from the patients for microbiological testing. Results: The median age of the study patients was 33 (15-88) years and 577 (58%) were females. The median age of males was 35 (15-87) years. The vast majority of cases occurred in urban area (849, 85%), p<0.01. Patients were admitted throughout the year with peak admissions for patients infected by bacterial pathogens in summer and those affected by viral pathogens in autumn. A total of 917 (91.7%) patients underwent a laboratory examination. The overall isolation rate was 51%. Bacterial pathogens were found in 29%, viral pathogens in 19% and protozoal pathogens in 2.5% of patients. No aetiological agent or other cause of acute diarrhoea was found in 449 (49%) patients. Twenty-nine (3.2%) patients were hospitalized. Conclusion: Despite extensive laboratory investigations, enteropathogens were detected in only 51% of adult patients who presented to the hospital ER with acute gastroenteritis. Viral infections ranked as the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in adults.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an important aetiological factor in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix. Limited studies have been focused on the differences between carcinogenesis of SCCs with and without HPV infection. Aims: The main goal of this study is to determine the expression of some of the apoptotic pathway regulators, including P53, Bax and Bcl2 in SCCs with and without high risk HPV 16/18 infection. Study Design: Cross sectional study. Methods: A total of 42 paraffin-embedded blocks with the histopathological diagnosis of invasive SCC with determined HPV 16/18 status were selected; half of them were HPV positive and the rest were negative. Afterwards, immunohistochemistry stained slides for p53, Bcl2 and Bax were evaluated with H-score, multiplicative and Additive Quick score by two pathologists; in cases of controversy about the results, the mean results were recorded. Results: Mean results and percentage of expression of our three markers were significantly higher in the HPV 16/18 infected group than in uninfected individuals: Respectively, the mean score for Bcl2, Bax and p53 staining according to H-scoring method was 68.5, 234, 106.4 in the HPV 16/18 infected group and 4.5, 218.8, 5.07 in the uninfected group; and the Multiplicative Quick score was 4, 14.6, 8.2 in the HPV 16/18 infected group and 3, 12.3, 3.5 in the uninfected group.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) can produce unusual radiographic findings. Further, negative sputum and bronchoscopic results are common. Early diagnosis is equally as significant as treatment in the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with pulmonary TB. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess computed tomography (CT) findings of pulmonary TB, confirmed via percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (PTNB), and to correlate these findings with coexisting, underlying, lung diseases if present. Study Design: Cross sectional study. Methods: We selected eighty-four patients who were diagnosed with pulmonary TB by way of PTNB. Initially, acid-fast bacilli smear test results from these patients were negative. CT findings were reviewed to detect the presence of parenchymal abnormalities as follows: nodule(s) (<3 cm in diameter), mass (any masses ≥3 cm), daughter nodules, air-space consolidation, cavitation, calcification, lymphadenopathy, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and associated lung parenchymal disease. Results: The CT findings of pulmonary TB confirmed by PTNB included nodules in 44 of 84 (52.4%) cases; 15 of these 44 cases (34.1%) had daughter nodules. The second most common finding was masses in 24 cases (28.6%), nine of which also had daughter nodules. 16 cases (19.0%) displayed nonsegmental consolidation. Of these 16 cases, four had coexisting usual interstitial pneumonia; four others had emphysema. Two patients with a mass had underlying pneumoconiosis. Conclusion: Nodules or a mass mimicking lung cancer were the most common findings on CT scans in patients with pulmonary TB, confirmed via PTNB. The second most common finding was airspace consolidation. Therefore, PNTB is useful for the accurate diagnosis of pulmonary TB in the following cases: airspace consolidation or mass associated with underlying usual interstitial pneumonia, emphysema mimicking lung malignancy or cases of bacterial pneumonia.",

Study Design: Cross sectional study. Methods: We selected eighty-four patients who were diagnosed with pulmonary TB by way of PTNB. Initially, acid-fast bacilli smear test results from these patients were negative. CT findings were reviewed to detect the presence of parenchymal abnormalities as follows: nodule(s) (<3 cm in diameter), mass (any masses ≥3 cm), daughter nodules, air-space consolidation, cavitation, calcification, lymphadenopathy, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and associated lung parenchymal disease. Results: The CT findings of pulmonary TB confirmed by PTNB included nodules in 44 of 84 (52.4%) cases; 15 of these 44 cases (34.1%) had daughter nodules. The second most common finding was masses in 24 cases (28.6%), nine of which also had daughter nodules. 16 cases (19.0%) displayed nonsegmental consolidation. Of these 16 cases, four had coexisting usual interstitial pneumonia; four others had emphysema. Two patients with a mass had underlying pneumoconiosis. Conclusion: Nodules or a mass mimicking lung cancer were the most common findings on CT scans in patients with pulmonary TB, confirmed via PTNB. The second most common finding was airspace consolidation. Therefore, PNTB is useful for the accurate diagnosis of pulmonary TB in the following cases: airspace consolidation or mass associated with underlying usual interstitial pneumonia, emphysema mimicking lung malignancy or cases of bacterial pneumonia.",

Hence, there is a need for methods which will enable us to characterize the accuracy of diagnostic tests when there are more than two possible disease states. Aims: To show that two information theory measures, information content (IC) and proportional reduction in diagnostic uncertainty (PRDU), can be used for the evaluation of the performance of diagnostic tests for multi-class diagnostic problems that may appear in different areas of medical science.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Pulmonary arterial hypertension secondary to untreated left-to-right shunt defects leads to increased pulmonary blood flow, endothelial dysfunction, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, vascular remodelling, neointimal and plexiform lesions. Some recent studies have shown that inflammation has an important role in the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Aims: The aim of this study is to evaluate serum pentraxin 3 and high sensitive (hs)-C reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in children with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) secondary to untreated congenital heart defects and evaluate the role of inflammation in pulmonary hypertension. Study Design: Cross sectional study. Methods: After ethics committee approval and receiving consent from parents, there were 31 children were selected for the study with severe PAH, mostly with a left-to-right shunt, who had been assessed by cardiac catheterisation and were taking specific pulmonary vasodilators. The control group consisted of 39 age and gender matched healthy children. After recording data about all the patients including age, gender, weight, haemodynamic studies and vasodilator testing, a physical examination was done for all subjects. Blood was taken from patients and the control group using peripheral veins to analyse serum Pentraxin 3, N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-ProBNP) and hs-CRP levels. Serum Pentraxin-3 levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and expressed as ng/mL. Serum hs-CRP levels were measured with an immunonephelometric method and expressed as mg/dL. The serum concentration of NT-proBNP was determined by a chemiluminescent immunumetric assay and expressed as pg/mL. Results: Serum Pentraxin- 3 levels were determined to be 1.28±2.12 (0.12-11.43) in the PAH group (group 1) and 0.40±0.72 (0.07-3.45) in group 2. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p<0.01). Serum hs-CRP levels were measured as 2.92±2.12 (0.32-14.7) mg/dL in group 1 and 0.35±0.16 (0.07-3.45) mg/dL in group 2. The hs-CRP level was increased in the PAH group to a significant degree (p<0.01). Conclusion: Our study showed that pentraxin 3 and hs-CRP levels were increased significantly in the PAH group.

The follow-up period ranged from one to eight years (mean 4.6 years). There were no recurrences or tumor-related fatalities. Conclusion: In the present study, the lipoleiomyomas were seen more frequently in patients with adenomyosis, endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and various gynecologic carcinomas. Lipoleiomyoma of the uterus seems to have a benign clinical course.",

Methods: Twenty-seven preterm infants were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care. Preterm infants with umbilical venous catheterization were included in the study. Six umbilical venous blood gas values were obtained from each infant during the first 72 hours of life. Preterm infants in the study were divided into two groups.

Aims: To characterize acute haemodialysis (HD)-induced changes in TDI-derived indices for patients that have end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Study Design: Cross sectional study. Methods: Conventional echocardiography and TDI methods were applied to study ESRD patients (n=58) before and after HD.

Results: Transmitral E and A velocities and the E/A ratio decreased significantly after HD (p<0.001). Pulmonary vein S (p<0.001) and D (p<0.001) velocities decreased, and S/D ratios increased significantly (p=0.027).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Adiponectin, which has anti-inflammatory features, is an important substance in several metabolic mechanisms. Aims: The aim of this study is to evauate the effects of exogenous intraperitoneal administration of adiponectin on the survival, intrabdominal adhesion and inflammatory cytokine levels in an experimental sepsis model. Study Design: Animal experimentation. Methods: Ninety rats were divided into a control group, adiponectin group and sham group. A cecal puncture abdominal sepsis model was performed in the adiponectin and control groups. Every three hours, exogenous adiponectin was administrated to the adiponectin group. At the 3rd and 24th hours, 10 rats were sacrified in each group in order to measure plasma tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL) 10, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, IL-6 and macrophage inhibitory factor levels, and the activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kB. The remaining rats were followed for survival. Results: The plasma levels of TNF-α, soluable ICAM-1, IL-6, and macrophage inhibitory factor were significantly higher in the control group than in the adiponectin and sham group (p<0.05). The increase in inflammatory cytokines with time was more prominent in the control group. The activity of NF-kB in the control group was higher than in the adiponectin group (p<0.05).

Congenital Byler Syndrome (Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis) inherited with autosomal recessive trait and characterized by defective secretion of bile acids. FMF associated Amyloid A deposition occurs in many tissues and organs, but amyloid goiter is a rare entity that leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the thyroid. Case Report: We present a rare case of 24 year old male patient who had liver and kidney transplantation due to Byler Syndrome and secondary amyloidosis related to FMF, diagnosed as rapidly growing large amyloid goiter. Deposits of extracellular amyloid and dense adipose metaplasia diagnostic for amyloid goiter are determined upon histopathological examination of thyroidectomy material. Conclusion: When goiter was detected in cases with history of systemic amyloidosis and rapidly growing goitre, amyloid goiter should be remembered at first. This case is unique since two autosomal genetic disorders are together in the same patient and important as it emphasizes the consequences of consanguineous marriage, early diagnosis and treatment compliance of FMF and the awareness of amyloid goiter in patients followed by primary care physicians and healthcare professionals.",

Congenital Byler Syndrome (Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis) inherited with autosomal recessive trait and characterized by defective secretion of bile acids. FMF associated Amyloid A deposition occurs in many tissues and organs, but amyloid goiter is a rare entity that leads to enlargement and dysfunction of the thyroid. Case Report: We present a rare case of 24 year old male patient who had liver and kidney transplantation due to Byler Syndrome and secondary amyloidosis related to FMF, diagnosed as rapidly growing large amyloid goiter. Deposits of extracellular amyloid and dense adipose metaplasia diagnostic for amyloid goiter are determined upon histopathological examination of thyroidectomy material. Conclusion: When goiter was detected in cases with history of systemic amyloidosis and rapidly growing goitre, amyloid goiter should be remembered at first. This case is unique since two autosomal genetic disorders are together in the same patient and important as it emphasizes the consequences of consanguineous marriage, early diagnosis and treatment compliance of FMF and the awareness of amyloid goiter in patients followed by primary care physicians and healthcare professionals.",
