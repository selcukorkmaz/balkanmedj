    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To evaluate factors affecting measurement quality of dynamic contour tonometry (DCT). Material and Methods: Three hundred patients took part in this prospective clinical study. For each patient, measurements for one eye were included in the study. Of the participants, 116 had ocular hypertension, 114 had glaucoma, and 70 had normal eyes. We used automatic refractokeratometry, ultrasonic pachimetry, Goldmann applanation tonometry, and DCT measurements to investigate the effects of age, corneal astigmatism, refractive error, central corneal thickness (CCT), intraocular pressures (IOP), and ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) on DCT measurement quality (Q). Logistic regression analysis was used for statistical analysis. Results: For 159 patients, the DCT Q score was 1 (group 1). For the remaining 141 patients, the Q score was 2–3 (group 2). The following values were determined for the two groups, respectively: mean age 58.9±9.9 and 61.4±10.6; mean corneal astigmatisms −0.78±0.67 and −0.92±0.77 diopter; mean spherical equivalents 0.33±1.87 and −0.01±2.02 diopter; mean CCT 547.0±35.2 and 549±38.7 μm. Measurements with DCT provided mean IOPs of 18.5±3.70 and 21.27±6.19 mm Hg and mean OPA 3.5±1.4 and 3.2±1.2 mm Hg. By logistic regression analysis, we determined that the parameters affecting measurement quality were age, DCT measurement level, and OPA (p=0.015, p=0.000, and p=0.000, respectively). Conclusion: High IOP values, advanced age, and low OPA values can lead to decreased DCT measurement quality.",

On the 3' and 5' ends of the genome, there are two untranslated regions (UTR) which are highly protected and which have 92% homology among various HCV types. 5' UTR is used for the genotype detection. In this study, genotype and nucleic acid changes in this region were analyzed. Material and Methods: In 51 patients diagnosed with HCV, HCV-RNA was isolated and purified from serum samples. The 341 nucleotide-long UTR region at the 5'end of the genome was sequenced and genotypes were detected. Nucleotide changes were analyzed with on-line BLAST program. Results: In 45 (88.2%) of 51 patients, genotype-1 (78.4% of all genotypes were 1b, 9.8% were 1a) was detected. In 41 (80.4%) of the 51 sequences, nucleic acid changes were detected.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The aim of the study is to analyze the general aspects of cases with carbon monoxide intoxication in order to improve the approach to future patients. Material and Methods: The hospital records of 84 children (mean age 4.71±2.64 years; 48 male, 36 female) who had been admitted to Paediatric Emergency Department for carbon monoxide intoxication between October 2007 and February 2009, were retrospectively evaluated in a descriptive analysis. Results: The source of carbon monoxide intoxication was heaters, waterheaters and fi re in 82.1%, 7.1% and 6% of cases, respectively. There was a statistically signifi cant difference between the carboxyhemoglobin levels of the patients according to the clinical classifi cation (p<0.05). The intoxication caused by heaters was observed signifi cantly in November, December and January (p<0.001), between 16:00-24:00 hours (p<0.001) and among more than one member of a family (p<0.001).

The cephalometric measurements and polysomnographic data of the patients were compared and a discriminatory analysis was performed. Results: The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was significantly higher in obese patients (p<0.01). Bimaxillary protrusion was found in obese patients (p<0.05). The non-obese patients with AHI ≥ 30 had an increased mandibular plane angle In the stepwise discriminant analysis done separately in obese and non-obese patients according to AHI; only the hyoid bone position was included in the model in obese patients and the estimated success of discrimination of AHI's level (<30 and ≥30) was 70.3%. Age, anterior face and posterior face height were included to the model in non-obese patients and the estimated success of discrimination was found as 79.2%.

Materials and Methods: OSAS diagnosed 85 patients who were obese [n=37; mean age (±SE), 49.41±1.54 year] and non-obese [n=48; mean age (±SE) 46.92±1.39 year] were included in the study. The cephalometric measurements and polysomnographic data of the patients were compared and a discriminatory analysis was performed. Results: The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was significantly higher in obese patients (p<0.01). Bimaxillary protrusion was found in obese patients (p<0.05). The non-obese patients with AHI ≥ 30 had an increased mandibular plane angle In the stepwise discriminant analysis done separately in obese and non-obese patients according to AHI; only the hyoid bone position was included in the model in obese patients and the estimated success of discrimination of AHI's level (<30 and ≥30) was 70.3%. Age, anterior face and posterior face height were included to the model in non-obese patients and the estimated success of discrimination was found as 79.2%. Conclusion: Craniofacial morphology has an effect on the severity of OSAS. If the craniofacial morphology tends toward a worsening of OSAS with obesity, the severity of the OSAS increases.",

Material and Methods: Twenty two patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were admitted to the study (Men/Women: 14/8, mean age: 62.4±8.8 years). Ten samples from left internal mammary(LIMA), radial arterial (RA) and saphenous vein (SV) grafts were collected for each. The samples were transported to the vascular laboratory in 4°C Krebs solution. Submaximal smooth muscle contraction was achieved first by 10-7M of phenylephrine solution.

The concentration-response curves were obtained of the vasodilatation response relative to the begining. Results: In the LIMA graft samples, the vasodilation response to dipyridamole was 43.2±1.6% and 97.6±4.1% at concentrations of 10-6M and 10-3.5M respectively. In RA graft samples, the vasodilation response to dipyridamole was 36.3±1.8% and 95.3± 2.7% at concentrations of 10-6M and 10-3.5M respectively.

Conclusions: The amplitude of relaxation response to dipyridamole of all grafts samples were similar, without statistically significant difference among the IMA, RA and SV grafts in the in vitro tissue bath system.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Quercetin has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. Tamoxifen is used for breast cancer. In this study, we have aimed to investigate the effects of quercetin and tamoxifen on telomerase enzyme activity and apoptosis in two cell lines. Methods: In this study, 10, 50 and 100 μM of quercetin and tamoxifen were used to treat MCF-7 and NIH-3T3. Apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL method (Terminal Deoxynucleotide Transferase dUTP Nick End Label) and telomerase enzyme activity was determined by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). Results: In the NIH3T3 cell line, only 100 μM quercetin and tamoxifen induced significant apoptosis. In the MCF-7 cell line 10 μM and 100 μM quercetin in the 24th hour and 100 μM quercetin in the 72 hour induce apoptosis. In 24th and 48th hours, 50 μM tamoxifen and 100 μM tamoxifen in the 24th and 48th hours induce apoptosis in the MCF-7 cell line. In MCF-7 and NIH-3T3 cell lines, all doses of quercetin and tamoxifen reduced telomerase enzyme activity compared to the control group. Conclusion: In this study, it was shown that quercetin has similar effects to tamoxifen. However quercetin induces apoptosis more than decreasing telomerase enzyme activities, being different from tamoxifen. We hope that the findings will assist in developing new therapeutic pathways for preventing breast cancer.

Material and Methods: Seventy-one volunteers from 4 popular heavy metal bars were included to the study. The Beck Depression Inventory, the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), the Adult Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD) Scale and the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) were administered to the participants. Results: One fourth of the participants (25.4%) were under high risk for a depressive episode (BDI>17), 22 (32.3%) reported significant social anxiety (LSAS>30), and 41 (57.7%) showed moderate ADHD symptoms (Adult ADD/ADHD scale: 20-59). According to BDI score participants who were under the risk for depression showed higher scores in Adult ADD/ADHD scale scores than that of participants who were not under a risk for depression (p=0.001 for attention deficit; p=0.003 for hyperactivity; p=0.002 for impulsivity; p=0.001 for total score). In the study group, ADD/ADHD scale attention deficit score was positively correlated with the total fear, total avoidence and the total scores of LSAS (r=.359 p<0.01; r=.332 p<0.01; r=.358 p<0.01, respectively).

Parapharyngeal involvement is very rare and, to our knowledge, five pediatric parapharyngeal Castleman's disease have been reported. We describe the case of a 14-year-old female child who was diagnosed as having parapharyngeal Castleman's disease.",
