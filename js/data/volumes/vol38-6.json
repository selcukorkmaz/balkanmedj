    "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have published the promoting effect of serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) in various malignant tumors. However, whether SGK1 promotes gastric cancer remains a mystery.Aims: To clarify the function of SGK1 in gastric cancer and its potential regulatory mechanism.Study Design: Cell culture study.Methods: The SGK1-silenced model was generated in two gastric cancer cell lines and further evaluated their malignant behavior and susceptibility to cisplatin. The interaction between miR-15a-5p and SGK1 was evaluated by the luciferase reporter assay. The knockdown efficiency of SGK1 was confirmed by RT- qPCR and Western blot assays. Cell proliferation rate was assessed with CCK-8 assay, and flow cytometry was used to determine cell cycle progression and apoptosis.Results: Western blot data displayed an elevated level of SGK1 in gastric cancer cell lines. Functionally, SGK1 deficiency suppressed gastric cancer cell proliferation (P < .01) by acting on cell-cycle progression. Moreover, SGK1 deficiency suppressed cell invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells (P < .01). Further, the silencing of SGK1 obviously suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of the cells after cisplatin treatment (P < .01), indicating that SGK1 deficiency facilitated the chemosensitivity of these 2 gastric cancer cell lines to cisplatin. Mechanically, downregulation of SGK1 repressed the cytoplasm- to-nucleus translocation of NF-κB p65. Interestingly, we found that miR-15a-5p binds to the 3'UTR of SGK1, which was confirmed using luciferase activity assay (P < .05). Moreover, the data suggested that SGK1 reversed the suppression effect of miR-15a-5p on gastric cancer cell migration (P < .01).Conclusion: Loss of SGK1 suppresses the malignant behavior of gastric cancer cells and increases cisplatin sensitivity by restraining the NF-κB signaling pathway. Moreover, SGK1 may exert an inhibitory effect in gastric cancer by being targeted by miR-15a-5p. Therefore, SGK1 may be a prospective target for future gastric cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "Background: There is no consensus on the optimal drainage technique in the management of biliary anastomotic strictures occurring after right-lobe living-donor liver transplantation (RL LDLT).Aims: To investigate whether there is a superiority between unilateral and bilateral drainage groups in terms of efficacy and safety of biliary drainage in RL LDLT patients undergoing double-biliary reconstruction.Study Design: Retrospective CohortMethods: Between January 2009 and August 2019, 1693 patients underwent RL LDLT. Of these, 182 patients who developed biliary anastomotic strictures out of the 306 patients who had double-biliary reconstruction, were included in the study. One hundred fifty-five patients with technical success were divided into 2 groups as unilateral (n=116) and bilateral (n=39) drainage groups. The groups were compared in terms of variable parameters such as clinical success, additional procedure, post-ERCP complication, procedures after clinical failure, hospital stay, mortality, and survival.Results: The clinical success was higher in the bilateral group (70% vs. 82%, P = .201). In the initial and the follow-up periods, a total of 44 (38%) patients in the unilateral group were switched to the bilateral drainage group due to the increased need for stenting. The placement of a stent successfully solved the problem only in 28% (32/117) of the patients in the unilateral group, while this rate was 44% (17/39) in the bilateral group. The median follow-up time of both groups was 42 months, and was equal. The number of stent-free follow-up patients in the unilateral drainage group was less than that in the bilateral drainage group (4 and 7, respectively).Conclusion: An active attempt should be made for bilateral drainage in patients with biliary anastomotic stricture following RL LDLT. However, for patients in whom bilateral drainage is not possible, unilateral drainage may be recommended, with the placement of a maximum number of stents following primary biliary balloon dilatation, depending on the degree of stricture.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cystic fibrosis, a pulmonary disease which is an autosomal recessive, inherited, multisystemic genetic disease commonly seen in the Caucasian race, is the most frequent cause of mortality and morbidity. So far, more than 2000 disease-causing gene variants have been found and this number has been increasing with the studies conducted. Although there is not yet enough data that include the Turkish population, the recent increase of studies is noteworthy.Aims: To discover the genetic variation in patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis in the Central Anatolian region.Study Design: Cross-sectional study.Methods: The study was carried out in the Central Anatolian region in 3 pediatric pulmonology departments (Kayseri, Konya, and Ankara) in Turkey between July 2014 and December 2017. The Sanger and Next Generation Sequence analyses were used for exon and exon–intron boundaries in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatory (CFTR) gene, and in selected patients, mutation analysis was performed using the Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification technique for large deletions and duplications.Results: CFTR gene analysis was performed for 316 patients and 215 of them were genetically diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Sixtythreedifferent variants were defined in these patients and 7 of these were large deletions/duplications detected with the MLPA method. The most frequent variants were F508del (29.6%), G85E (8.2%), N1303K (8.2%), Y515* (7.5%), and G542* (3.4%).Conclusion: Using sequencing and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification methods, the identification of seven new mutations that were not previously reported in the literature contributes to a better understanding of the heterogeneous nature of CFTR mutations in the Turkish population. When no mutations are detected (pathogenic/probably pathogenic) in clinically compatible cases, Multiplex Ligationdependent Probe Amplification analysis contributes significantly to the diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Background: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous disorder that results in a predisposition to the growth of multiple tumors in the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, and the skin. The clinical manifestations of neurofibromatosis are associated with loss of neurofibromin expression which causes the upregulation of the RAS pathway. Although neurofibromatosis type 1 can be diagnosed based on the National Institutes of Health criteria, sometimes the diagnosis is difficult, in cases where the characteristic features do not develop. Moreover, other RAS-related disorders may present with significantly overlapping clinical features.Aims: To determine the clinical and molecular genetic characteristics of Turkish patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.Study design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: For the genetic analysis of 27 Turkish families clinically diagnosed with NF1 between 1990 and 2019, we used a multi-step process consisting of next-generation sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, and array-comparative genomic hybridization.Results: In this study, we identified 11 novel and 11 previously reported single-nucleotide variants in 22 families. Whole gene deletions were detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis in 3 families. Of those, array comparative genomic hybridization analysis defined a 17q11.2 deletion in 4 patients from 2 families and 1.2-Mb involving 1 unrelated patient. All patients with a deletion had facial dysmorphism, suggesting a peculiar phenotype in this group. We could not find any pathogenic variant in the 2 families that met the National Institutes of Health criteria.Conclusion: The novel pathogenic variants identified in this study broaden the spectrum of pathogenic variants in NF1 and provide better clinical characterization of NF1. RNA-seq experiments are recommended in patients who meet the National Institutes of Health diagnostic criteria for NF but have not identified any variants in nextgeneration sequencing, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, or array-comparative genomic hybridization analysis.",

According to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes, 1473 silicosis cases were detected. The sociodemographic characteristics, job characteristics, comorbidities, serological, functional, and radiological data, and follow-up time were obtained from the medical records. Mortality data were gathered from The National Death Notification System of Ministry of Health.Results: The study examined 9769 cases diagnosed with an occupational disease, and 15.0% (n = 1473) of them were diagnosed with silicosis. The median age of silicosis patients was 40.0 years, and 26.9% of them were child labor when they started to work in dusty industries. Child labor was mostly seen among dental technicians (57.7%), denim sandblasters (46.4%), and miners (37.0%). In the follow-up period, 26.3% of Teflon sandblasters, 11.1% of coal miners, 8.6% of denim sandblasters had died before their average life expectancy, and the years of loss of life was 26.0 ± 11.6 years all over the group. Premature death was associated with occupation [hazard ratio (Teflon sandblasting): 3.93, CI: 1.43-10.78; hazard ratio (marble production): 4.4, CI: 1.02-19.21]; large opacities in posterior anterior chest X-ray [hazard ratio: 2.14, CI: 1.18-3.86]; tuberculosis [hazard ratio: 2.60, CI: 1.42- 4.76]; and reduction in forced vital capacity (forced vital capacity% ≤80) during diagnosis [hazard ratio: 4.43, CI: 2.22-8.83].Conclusion: More than a quarter of silicosis cases are those who start working in dusty industries at an early age. Factors associated with premature death in patients with silicosis are patient occupation, large opacities on chest X-ray, tuberculosis, and pulmonary function loss at diagnosis. <",
