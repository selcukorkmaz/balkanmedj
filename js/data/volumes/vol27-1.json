Coronary artery disease happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed.

As a result heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack.

In this review diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment issues of syncope will be discussed from a standpoint of neurologists.",

Patients and Methods: Fourteen adult HD patients (7 men, 7 women; mean age 59.7±17.2 years; range 41 to 88 years) with history of pruritus of more than eight weeks were assigned to receive 8-week gabapentin (300 mg per day) therapy. The daily pruritus were recorded using visual analogue scale for each period of the study during one week preceding the trial, the active treatment phase, the placebo phase and the intervening 1-week washout period. Sleep quality was determined with a modified post-sleep inventory, quality of life with a short form of Medical Outcomes Study (SF-36), depression using the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: The mean pruritus score and total of post-sleep inventory were decreased significantly with gabapentin therapy (p=0.01 and p=0.002 respectively). Physical and mental component scales of SF-36 increased, whereas cognitive and somatic depression index decreased with gabapentin. Conclusion: We concluded that beneficial effects of gabapentin therapy on pruritus, quality of life, depression and sleep quality are clinically important in HD patients with pruritus. Gabapentin therapy should be taken into account as an important choice of therapy in pruritic HD patients.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Midwives and nurses are considered as the essential sources of information about feeding and nutrition of the babies, who encourage breastfeeding and support the mother. In this study, it is aimed to compare the knowledge and attitudes of midwives and nurses about breastfeeding with breastfeeding practices of the mothers they provide counseling on baby feeding. Patients and Methods: The present study was carried out on 161 mothers having babies aged 12-18 months who lived in Edirne and on 59 midwives and nurses who had conducted their counseling and follow-up visits. Data were collected via two questionnaires prepared for the midwives and mothers. Results: Midwives/nurses reported that they were visited by each mother for a mean of 6.5±2.9 times during their pregnancy. Twenty-two of them had fed their babies only with breast milk for at least six months and 33 of them had suckled their babies for at least 12 months. Of the mothers, 65 had fed their babies only with breast milk for at least six months, while 82 had suckled their babies for at least 12 months. Conclusion: This study stresses the importance that nurses/midwives should enhance mothers' consciousness for a successful breastfeeding. It is important that midwives should provide continuous support to mothers, which can be achieved by continuous professional training to midwives, nurses and other health staff regularly.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Smokers had higher risk than nonsmokers for pain. The incidence of pain on injection of propofol has been reported to be 70%. We explored the relationship between smoking habits and propofol injection pain, whether nicotine replacement has an influence on intensity or incidence of pain associated with propofol in smokers. Patients and Methods: Two hundred patients ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status 1, undergoing elective surgical procedures were studied. Hundred (50-50) patients who used cigarette were included in smoker group and nicotine group. Hundred (50-50) patients who never used tobacco were included in nonsmoker (NS) group and NS+nicotine group. Prior to surgery, the anesthesiologist gave a nicotine gum to nicotine group which was randomized in smokers and nonsmokers. The severity of propofol injection pain was evaluated using four point scale (none, mild, moderate, and severe). Results: Incidence of pain was higher in the smoker group compared with the nonsmoker, nicotine and NS+nicotine groups. The intensity of mild pain was higher in the smoker group compared with the nonsmoker group. The intensity of moderate+severe pain was lower in the NS+nicotine group compared with the nonsmoker and smoker and nicotine groups. Conclusion: The incidence of propofol injection pain and intensity of mild pain increased in smokers deprived of nicotine. Nicotine replacement in these patients reduced the incidence of propofol injection pain similar to nonsmokers. When nonsmokers were given nicotine, intensity of moderate+severe pain decreased. These results suggest that smokers' awareness of pain increases and nicotine has an analgesic effect.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Although the most commonly used scale is the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) in neurological intensive care units (NICU), it has some shortcomings. Many attempts have been made to design new scales that could provide further neurological detail in coma. The FOUR score (Full Outline of UnResponsiveness) is a new coma scale. The aim of this study is the validation of the Turkish version of the FOUR score and comparison of it with the GCS. Patients and Methods: A total of consecutive 124 patients (65 males, 59 females; mean age 68.4±14.7 years; range 26 to 96 years) who were admitted to the seven NICUs between 2006-2007 were enrolled in the study. Each patient was rated on both scales by two different neurologists within one hour after each other without knowledge of the other's scores. Morbidity was assessed at hospital discharge using the modified Rankin Scale. Results: The inter-rater reliability was excellent for both FOUR score (K=0.68; %95 CI, 0.59-077) and GCS (K=0.69; %95 CI, 0.60-0.77). Outcome prediction of the FOUR score was as effective as GCS. Conclusion: The FOUR score has major advantages and provide important details of the neurologic examination such as brainstem reflexes and eye movements. We believe our results suggest that the FOUR score could be used instead of GCS in the NICUs in Turkey.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical features and long-term follow-up of the patients with a histopathological diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia of the chest wall. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study was performed in 16 patients (all males; mean age 26.2 years; range 20-48 years) with histopathologically confirmed fibrous dysplasia who admitted to our department between 1995 and 2008. Patients were evaluated with respect to sex, age, symptoms, clinical features, radiologic and scintigraphic findings, surgical approach for diagnosis and treatment, hospital stay after operation, recurrence, morbidity and mortality. Results: Two patients were asymptomatic. The main symptoms were chest pain in 12 patients and chest wall swelling with chest pain in two patients. Thirteen patients had monostotic disease, and three polyostotic disease. The surgical treatment and biopsy were carried out in all patients with partial or total rib resections. The diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically. There were no postoperative morbidity and mortality. The median hospitalization was 5.6 (3-8) days. Follow-up was possible in 12 patients and ranged from 2 to 112 months (median 39.6 months). There was no recurrence or any other pathology. Conclusion: The clinical picture of fibrous dysplasia can be monostotic, polyostotic or more than one rib with extrathoracic involvement like our series.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology and is characterized by noncaseating granulomas in organs. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that chronic inflammation may impair arterial function and lead to an increase in arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV) in patients with sarcoidosis. Patients and Methods: We recruited 19 patients (12 women, 7 men) with sarcoidosis, and 19 sex-matched healthy controls. Aortic PWV was determined by using an automatic device, the Complior Colson (France), which allowed on-line pulse wave recording and automatic calculation of PWV. Results: The PWV, glucose, LDL cholesterol, uric acid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were higher in patients with sarcoidosis than in control subjects (p=0.04, p=0.03, p=0.02, p=0.008, p=0.04, p=0.005, respectively). We found significant correlation between PWV and age (p=0.001, r=0.52), body mass index (p=0.01, r=0.40), systolic blood pressure (p<0.001, r=0.71), diastolic blood pressure (p<0.001, r=0.63), mean blood pressure (p<0.001, r=0.68), pulse pressure (p<0.001, r=0.63), pulse transit time (p<0.001, r=-0.90), total cholesterol (p=0.002, r=0.47) and LDL cholesterol (p=0.001, r=0.51).

Patients and Methods: Necropsy records of 140 cases (77 boys, 63 girls; mean age 31.6 months; range 1 to 5 years), which were referred to Ankara Forensic Group between 2003 and 2007, were reviewed retrospectively. Results: The number of male cases was greater than that of female cases, though not statistically significant. Forensic death rate was higher in 2006 and 2007 (36 cases) than others. The most frequent cause of death was asphyxia (48 cases), followed by injury (28 cases) and infections (20 cases). Conclusion: We detected that most of the causes of childhood deaths were due to preventable reasons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: This study was undertaken to investigate copper, zinc, iron, and selenium in a rat model of cadmium toxicity and effects of antioxidant substances such as taurine, melatonin and N-acetylcysteine. Materials and Methods: Ninety male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into nine groups. Group 1 received tap water comprising the controls; the remaining eight groups received 200 µg/ml cadmium chloride (CdCl2) for three months. Group 2 had CdCl2. Groups 3, 4, and 5 were administered taurine, melatonin and N-acetylcystein for three months together with CdCl2. Groups 6, 7, 8, and 9 had CdCl2 for three months and then only water as the second control or antioxidants for seven days. Cadmium, copper, zinc, iron, and selenium levels of heart and brain were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results: Cadmium accumulated in significant amounts in brain and heart tissues when compared with controls. CdCl2 levels in Group 1 and Group 2 were 2.56±0.77 and 27.2±5.82 in the heart, 46.16±14.81 and 300.34±58.19 in the brain, respectively (p<0.001). We found that melatonin was more effective in brain tissue (p<0.05) whereas N-acetylcysteine was more effective in heart tissue (p<0.001) against cadmium accumulation. Conclusion: We suggest that taurine, melatonin and N-acetylcysteine have some protective effects in brain and heart tissues against cadmium accumulation. Furthermore, trace element levels were restorated in different degrees after taurine, melatonin and N-acetylcysteine administration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of both regular swimming training and vitamin E supplementation on the thioredoxin system, one of the key player in defense against oxidative stress. In order to examine the effects of regular physical exercise on the antioxidant defenses of tissues and on their susceptibility to damage induced by exercise, the activity of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) have been determined. Materials and Methods: Four groups of male rats were used. Two groups were trained to swim for nine weeks. One trained and one sedentary group received vitamin E supplementation for four days a week. Results: Thiobarbituric acid-reacting substance (TBARS) levels of the trained group significantly decreased (p<0.01) in the liver and the brain. Meanwhile, both regular exercise and vitamin E supplementation caused increases (p<0.001) in TrxR activities in all tissues. Conclusion: These results suggest that increased activity of TrxR is an important oxidative response of the thioredoxin system and plays an important protection role against protein damage. It is also likely that vitamin E depletion in oxidative stress may require recycling process of this molecule in relation to TrxR, supporting with the TrxR activities of tissues in both trained and vitamin E-supplemented group.",
