Patients and Methods: A total of 36 patients (20 girls, 16 males; mean age 8.6±5.9; range 1 month to 15 years) treated in our hospital for congenital neck mass between 1996 and 2003, were retrospectively analysed. Results: Thirteen cases were diagnosed as dermoid cyst, 7 as branchial cyst, 7 as thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC), 5 as torticollis, 4 as cystic hygroma and 1 as lipoblastoma. In all 7 of the cases with TDC, the mass presented with a cutaneus fistula. Two of the branchial cysts were localized on the right and the rest on the left side. One of the cases with dermoid cyst exhibited a lateral localization. Ultrasonography, computed tomography and thyroid syntigraphy were used for diagnostic purposes. Three patients with torticollis received physical therapy while the remaining patients were surgically treated. The preliminary diagnosis was incorrect in four cases and their histopathological diagnosis was dermoid cyst. Conclusion: Congenital neck masses in children are usually benign. Due to their similar clinical features, dermoid cysts can be confused with TDC and branchial cysts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The present study was designed to determine the bacteria causing urinary tract infections (UTI) in our hospital and their susceptibility to various antibiotics. Study Design: Susceptibility of 259 uropathogen Escherichia Coli (E. Coli) isolates from urine samples of patients treated in the wards and intensive care units or in the outpatient clinics of our hospital between March 2004 and February 2005, to ampicillin, amoxycillin-clavulanate, gentamicin, ceftriaxone, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, and nalidixic acid, the most commonly used antibiotics in UTI, were evaluated. Among the isolated strains, 63 were from nosocomial and 196 were from community acquired UTI. Identification and susceptibility of strains were determined by an automatized VITEK-1 panel (Biomérieux, France). Results: Comparison of antibiotic susceptibility rates between nosocomial and community-acquired UTI revealed the following results: ampicillin 63-32%, amoxycillin- clavulanate 78-58%, gentamicin 89-83%, ceftriaxone 94-89%, ofloxacin 82-59%, ciprofloxacin 81-54%, cotrimoxazole 71-47%, nalidixic acid 86-64%, nosocomial and community-acquired UTI, respectively. Conclusion: In our opinion, for our region, ciprofloxacin would be the appropriate option for ampiric therapy in patients with probable community-acquired UTI and ampiric parenteral treatment with ceftriaxone would be the appropriate first option in patients with probable nosocomial UTI.",

Results: Median value of IgE was (%25-75) 202 U/ml (118-530) in the patients enrolled. The most frequent symptom was shortness of breath (65.3%), and the second was cough (63.8%). These symptoms aggravated while patients were dusting. Sensitivity to at least one allergen was observed in 59.7% of the patients. Sensitivity to a single allergen was present in 18.9% and to multiple allergens in 40.8% of all patients. The most frequent allergy was determined to house dust mite (39.8%) and was followed by allergy to tree pollens (26%). Sensitivity rate to D. Farinea was 33.7% and 32.7% to D. Pteronyssinus. Conclusion: House dust mite were the primary causes of sensitization in patients presenting with allergic symptoms in the Thrace region. The fact that the symptoms aggravated in 46.9% of the patients while they were dusting at home, seemed to support this finding.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, in his book named “De Architectura”, stated that the height of a person is equal to his or her length of outstreched arms and fits to a square. He also divided one's height into four equal parts and stated that the length of each of these parts equals to 25% of the height of the individual. This study aimed to investigate to what extent Turkish men fit the Vitruvius square and its equations. Study Design: Specific body distances of 50 male students were determined by anthropometric measurement techniques and recorded in forms prepared in advance. Then, the arithmetic means and standard deviations were calculated for each distance and compared with the Vitruvius square and related equations. Results: The height of the participants was 173.3±6.83 cm and their length of outstretched arms was 178.4±7.38 cm. Only 16% of the subjects were determined to fit to the square, 12% remained within the square and 72% were out of the square. Additionally, a very low proportion of the participants met the equations. Conclusion: It was observed that a great majority of Turkish men do not fit “Vitruvius square” and its equations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The role of proliferative and apoptotic mechanisms in various endometrial pathologies and in proliferative and atrophic endometria was assessed by immunohistochemical methods. Patients and Methods: A total of 55 cases consisting of 13 endometrioid carcinomas, eight cases of endometrial hyperplasia, 15 cases of disordered proliferation, 12 cases with proliferative and seven with inactive/athrophic endometria gathered from the local archives were included in the study. Immunohistochemical markers and stains, namely bcl-2, an antiapopitotic marker, and Ki-67, a proliferative marker were applied to the sections of selected diagnostic tissue blocks. Additionally, mitotic counts per 10 high power fields were obtained in cases of hyperplasia and carcinoma. Results: Mean H-score value for bcl-2 reaction was 0.48 for endometrioid carcinoma. Mean H-score values for cases of hyperplasia, disordered proliferation, proliferation and atrophy were calculated as 1.93, 1.62, 1.5 and 1.0, respectively. Ki-67 proliferation index for endometrioid carcinoma was 48.9%. This index was 32%, 29%, 31.5% and 8.4% for hyperplasia, disordered proliferation, proliferation and atrophy, respectively. Conclusion: Staining with bcl–2 peaked in cases of hyperplasia, and lost its intensity as nuclear atypia became evident. Weakest staining was observed in cases with grade II and III endometrioid carcinomas. In contrast, proliferative indexes increased with increasing grades of carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and reproductive factors such as parity, age of menopause, and duration of menopause on bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women were investigated. Patients and Methods: Age, reproductive history and HRT data of 322 postmenopausal women (mean age 52.4±6.2 years; range 38- 76) who applied to the outpatient menopause clinic of Trakya University Medical Faculty were gathered from the medical archives of the outpatient clinic. Patients were grouped according to the duration and current status of estrogen therapy and the effects of these variables on BMD were analysed. Bone mineral densities of lumbar spine, femur, trochanter, and Ward's triangle sites were measured by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). Results: Bone mineral densities of trochanter, and Ward's triangle sites of postmenopausal women who received HRT for more than 3 years were found to be significantly higher than those women who were treated for less than 3 years. Vertebral bone densities were significantly higher in postmenopausal women who received HRT for more than 3 years, compared to those women who were never treated with HRT. Ward's triangle and vertebral bone densities were significantly higher in postmenopausal women who received HRT for more than 3 years and those currently on HRT, compared to those women who never received HRT. BMD values of women who started but interrupted their HRTs, were similar to the values found in women who never received HRT. Increasing parity and duration of menopause were the factors that reduced BMD values. Conclusion: It appeared that BMD of hip and spine increased in postmenopausal women after the third or more years on HRT and during the period of treatment with HRT.

Yirmi dokuz yaşında erkek hasta, sağ boyun bölgesinde ağrı ve pulsatil kitle nedeniyle başvurdu. Fizik muayenede, sağ klavikula üzerinde hassasiyet, ödem, kızarıklık ve pulsatil kitle vardı. Sol alt ekstremitede eritema nodozum benzeri lezyon (ENBL) skarı ile uyumlu hiperpigmente lezyonlar görüldü. Paterji testi şüpheli pozitifti. Göz muayenesinde geçirilmiş üveit sekeli olduğu saptandı. Kontrastlı toraks tomografisinde subklavyan arterde trombüs içeren psödoanevrizmayla uyumlu görüntü vardı. Olgunun tanısı Behçet hastalığı kabul edildi. Tedavinin dördüncü günü psödoanevrizmanın pariyetal plevraya invaze olarak, intraplevral boşluğa kanaması üzerine şok gelişti. Acil olarak subklavyan arter baypas ameliyatı uygulandı. Yirmi birinci gün greft trombozu gelişti, aynı kateter içinden streptokinaz infüzyonuna başlandı. Tedavi ile 12 saat içinde tam açıklık sağlandı. Üç ay sonra tekrar tromboz gelişmesine karşın kollaterallerin distal doluşu sağladığı görüldü. İdame tedavi ile hastanın klinik takibine devam edilmektedir. <",

Study Design: Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 9 groups. During the 3 months treatment period, group 1 received drinking water, group 2 200 ppm CdCl2, group 3 200 ppm CdCl2 and 1% taurine, to, group 4, 200 ppm CdCl2 and 0.02% melatonin, and group 5 received 200 ppm CdCl2 and 0.5% NAC all added into drinking water in each group. After, groups 6, 7, 8 and 9 received 200 ppm CdCl2 in their drinking water for 3 months, group 6 was given drinking water, group 7, 4% taurine, group 8, 0.08% melatonin and group 9, 2% NAC, each for 7 days. Results: Melatonin and NAC which were given for protective purposes, increased the decreased glutathione levels. The 3 substances that were administered for both protective and therapeutic purposes, decreased the increased malondialdehyde levels, one of the end products of lipid peroxidation. Conclusion: Taurine, melatonin and NAC play protective and therapeutic roles in CdCl2 induced lung injury.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The effect of long-term alcohol administration on brain arginase enzyme activity, ornithine and urea levels and the changes induced by administration of vitamins C and E were investigated. Study Design: Seventy-five male Wistar Albino rats between 4-6 months of age were used. Five study groups, each consisting of 15 rats were formed. The first group received oral glucose with a calorie value equivalent to alcohol. The second group received alcohol, the third, fourth and fifth groups received vitamins C, E and C+E, respectively, in addition to alcohol, for 20 weeks. All animals were sacrificed by the end of 20 weeks and arginase activity, ornithine and urea levels were measured in brain tissue samples. Results: In the treatment groups, arginase activities, ornithine and urea levels were significantly higher than the alcohol group (group 2). Conclusion: These results suggest that the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzyme which isshown to have increased in chronic alcohol intake, may cause a decrease in arginase enzyme activity via depleting the L-arginine pool. Antioxidant replacement therapy may increase the arginase enzyme activity and therefore lead to a decrease in nitric oxide production which has been shown to have some negative effects. On the other hand, simultaneously increased polyamine production may potentiate the beneficial effects of these vitamins.Thus, vitamins C and E may prove to be effective in reducing the deleterious effects of chronic alcohol consumption.",
