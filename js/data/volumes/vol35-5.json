    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is based on clinical symptoms, examination findings, and electrodiagnostic studies. For carpal tunnel syndrome, the most useful of these are nerve conduction studies. However, nerve conduction studie can result in ambiguous or false-negative results, particularly for mild carpal tunnel syndrome. Increasing the number of nerve conduction studie tests improves accuracy but also increases time, cost, and discomfort. To improve accuracy without additional testing, the terminal latency index and residual latency are additional calculations that can be performed using the minimum number of tests. Recently, the median sensory-ulnar motor latency difference was devised as another way to improve diagnostic accuracy for mild carpal tunnel syndrome.Aims: The median sensory-ulnar motor latency difference, terminal latency index, and residual latency were compared for diagnostic accuracy according to severity of carpal tunnel syndrome.Study Design: Diagnostic accuracy study.Methods: A total of 657 subjects were retrospectively enrolled. The carpal tunnel syndrome group consisted of 546 subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome according to nerve conduction studie (all severities). The control group consisted of 121 subjects with no hand symptoms and normal nerve conduction studie. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS v9.4. Means were compared using one-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni adjustment. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were compared, including receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.Results: For mild carpal tunnel syndrome, the median sensory-ulnar motor latency difference showed higher specificity and positive predictive value rates (0.967 and 0.957, respectively) than terminal latency index (0.603 and 0.769, respectively) and residual latency (0.818 and 0.858, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic was highest for the median sensory-ulnar motor latency difference (0.889), followed by the residual latency (0.829), and lastly the terminal latency index (0.762). Differences were statistically significant (median sensory-ulnar motor latency difference being the most accurate). For moderate carpal tunnel syndrome, sensitivity and specificity rates of residual latency (0.989 and 1.000) and terminal latency index (0.983 and 0.975) were higher than those for median sensory-ulnar motor latency difference (0.866 and 0.958). Differences in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were not significantly significant, but median sensory-ulnar motor latency difference sensitivity was lower. For severe carpal tunnel syndrome, residual latency yielded 1.000 sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and area beneath the receiver operating characteristic curve. Differences in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were not significantly different.Conclusion: The median sensory-ulnar motor latency difference is the best calculated parameter for diagnosing mild carpal tunnel syndrome. It requires only a simple calculation and no additional testing. Residual latency and the terminal latency index are also useful in diagnosing mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Hamstrings are one of the most frequently evaluated muscle groups for flexibility in the lower extremity. Passive and active knee extension angle values are used as an indirect indicator of hamstring flexibility. However, the lack of consensus on the cut-off values leads to the use of inconsistent angle values in determining the hamstring tightness. Aims: To establish the normative and cut-off values of the passive and active knee extension angles for healthy young adults and to determine the associated factors including the quadriceps strength. Study Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: A total of 123 volunteer university students, aged 18-24 years, who met the inclusion criteria were included in this study. Passive and active knee extension assessments of the subjects were performed. Subsequently, on the next day, both knee extensor concentric muscle strength of the participants was measured in the isokinetic system. The knee extension angles and the knee extensor strength were recorded as the mean values of the right and the left sides. Results: Passive knee extension angles of 17.1°±9.1° and 9.8°±5.7° and active knee extension angles of 17.8°±9.1° and 13.4°±6° were described as normative values in men and women, respectively. The cut-off values for the diagnosis of hamstring shortness were as follows: passive knee extension angle >32.2° for males and >19.2° for females and active knee extension angle >33.0° for males and >23.4° for females. A significant positive correlation was observed between knee extension angles and isokinetic knee extensor muscle strength in all participants. The knee extension angle and hamstring flexibility were not affected by dominance. Conclusion: The knee extension angles of healthy young people seem to be lower than the results currently reported in the literature. There s a positive correlation between knee extension angles and isokinetic knee extensor muscle strength.",

Unlike other monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab and adalimumab, certolizumab does not contain an Fc fraction and hence does not induce complement activation. In this report, we describe the case of a patient with thrombotic microangiopathy caused due to certolizumab pegol, with a brief description about the pathophysiological approach to thrombotic microangiopathy. Case Report: A-39-year-old man suffering from ankylosing spondylitis for the past 10 years presented with fatigue. He had been on certolizumab pegol treatment for 6 months, starting with 400 and 200 mg every 2 weeks. He had significant nonimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia without a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Schistocytes were observed in more than 10% of the erythrocytes per field. Plasma exchange along with corticosteroid treatment was started. There was a dramatic improvement within a week, and after 10 sessions of plasma exchange, the patient was discharged on corticosteroids with a tapering plan. ADAMTS13 enzyme activity was determined to be normal. Conclusion: The development of drug-induced thrombotic microangiopathy may be either immune-mediated or dose-dependent toxicity-mediated Anti-drug antibodies and their immunological aspects are still unclear and yet to be elucidated.",
