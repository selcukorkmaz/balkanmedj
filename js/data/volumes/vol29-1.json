The purpose of our study was to compare the efficacy of axillary brachial plexus block using an ultrasound technique with peripheral nerve stimulation technique. Material and Methods: Sixty patients for whom elective forearm and hand surgery was planned were included in the study. Group 1 (n=30) was given an axillary block by using ultrasonography, Group 2 (n=30) was given axillary block by using a peripheral nerve stimulator. The quality and time of onset of the sensorial and motor blockade were assessed. Results: The average time needed to perform the axillary brachial plexus block was similar in both groups. Although not significant statistically, it was observed that the sensory block was achieved earlier in Group 1. However, the degree of motor blockade was more intense in Group 1 than in Group 2. Conclusion: The ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block is a preferable method with faster onset time and better quality of motor blockade compared to the PNS technique.",

We have investigated the histological features, pathological stage, nuclear grade and sarcomatoid differentiation of these tumors. Material and Methods: Histological slides from seventy-eight nephrectomy specimens diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma between 2000 and 2008 were reevaluated according to the 2004 World Health Organization classification system of kidney tumors. Reclassified cases were collected in five groups and were scored for Fuhrman nuclear grading, stage, sarcomatoid differentiation and survival rate. Results: In our study, cases with high nuclear grade, advanced stage and sarcomatoid differentiation revealed poor survival rates (p<0.05). In conclusion, the correlation between prognostic histopathological parameters and survival rates was consistent with literature findings. Conclusion: Fuhrman nuclear grading, stage and sarcomatoid differentiation are important parameters and are related factors in survival when investigating renal cell carcinomas. Fuhrman nuclear grading must be evaluated correctly and the highest grade should be reported. Although there aren't enough studies about sarcomatoid differentiation, its presence significantly decreases survival rates.

Nine patients were secondary cases. The urethra proximal to the meatus was mobilized for a distance sufficient to allow it to reach the glans tip without tension. Then, the urethra was placed in the glanular bed and glanular reconstruction was performed. Operation duration, distance between the urethral meatus and the glans tip; and urethral mobilization length were measured and post-operative complications were noted. Results: Operation durations were similar in both groups. Three-fold urethral mobilization was sufficient for construction of tension-free urethra-glanular anastomosis. No fistula or retraction of the urethral meatus and chordee were observed. One patient required meatotomy. Conclusion: Distal hypospadias repair with the LUM technique is simple and effective.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 36 DTC patients who had RAI treatment in our department between 1992-2009 and whose 5 mCi (185 MBq) I-131 WBS were negative, but Tg values were ≥2 ng/ml during the ablation outcome control (Patient group). Thirty-six patients whose Tg values were < 2 ng/ml and showed no discordance at the same control made up the control group. Patient and control groups were compared in terms of age, gender, histopathological features, ablation dose, Tg value before ablation, and 24. hour RAI uptake value during ablation. The patient group was then evaluated for the cause of the discordance. Results: There were 28 female and 8 male patients whose mean age was 45.6±11.39 in patient group. In the control group, there were 29 female and 7 male patients whose mean age was 41.5±11.69. According to the reason of discordance at the ablation outcome control, the patient group was divided into 2 groups: 15 (42%) patients (9 female, 6 male patients, mean age: 50.66±10.73) who had metastatic lymph nodes as the reason of discordance constituted the lymph node group. The remaining 21 (58%) patients (19 female, 2 male patients, mean age: 41.5±10.44) were the micrometastatic group in which the cause of discordance could not be determined. There were statistically significant differences in soft tissue invasion (p<0.003), Tg levels before RAI treatment (p<0.002), and diameter of tumor >2 cm (p<0.035) between patient and control groups. Among the patient group, male gender (p<0.03), diameter of tumor >2 cm (p<0.05), thyroid capsule invasion (p<0.03), and age>40 (p<0.01) were significantly different between lymph node and micrometastatic groups. Conclusion: I-131 WBS/Tg level discordance at the ablation outcome control is mainly caused by metastatic lymph nodes.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Objective: We aimed to evaluate the discordance of 5 mCi (185 MBq) I-131 whole body scan (WBS) and thyroglobulin (Tg) values at the ablation outcome control in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients who had thyroidectomy and then received radioiodine (RAI) ablation. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 36 DTC patients who had RAI treatment in our department between 1992-2009 and whose 5 mCi (185 MBq) I-131 WBS were negative, but Tg values were ≥2 ng/ml during the ablation outcome control (Patient group). Thirty-six patients whose Tg values were < 2 ng/ml and showed no discordance at the same control made up the control group. Patient and control groups were compared in terms of age, gender, histopathological features, ablation dose, Tg value before ablation, and 24. hour RAI uptake value during ablation. The patient group was then evaluated for the cause of the discordance. Results: There were 28 female and 8 male patients whose mean age was 45.6±11.39 in patient group. In the control group, there were 29 female and 7 male patients whose mean age was 41.5±11.69. According to the reason of discordance at the ablation outcome control, the patient group was divided into 2 groups: 15 (42%) patients (9 female, 6 male patients, mean age: 50.66±10.73) who had metastatic lymph nodes as the reason of discordance constituted the lymph node group.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Mallampati scoring is the most common examination method for predicting possible intubation problems. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship of facial anthropometric measurements with the modified Mallampati score (MMS). Material and Methods: The study population consisted of 153 male and 170 female volunteers (mean ages, 48,9±16,9 and 44,1±15,4 years, respectively). All participants were subjected to Mallampati scoring and facial anthropometric measurements during pre-operative visit. Anthropometric measurements included inter-incisor gap, lower face height, thyrogonial length, thyromental distance and bigonial distance. The relationship of anthropometric measurements with the MMS was investigated by statistical analysis. Results: Bigonial distance showed a positive correlation with the MMS (r=0.857; p<0.001), whereas inter-incisor gap, lower face height, and thyromental distance showed negative correlations (r=-0.809, r=-0.738, and r=-0.762 respectively p<0.001 for all). ROC and AUC analysis showed that the BGD level had the highest significant AUC (p<0.001). Optimal cut-off point for BGD was >113 mm, and at this cut-off point, the sensitivity rate was 94.8% and the specificity rate was 95.9%. BGD was the best predictor for discriminating MMS 3-4.

Results: The mean time for decannulation and nasogastric tube removal were 11.8±7.6 and 15.4±4.4 days, respectively. The mean duration of hospital stay was 19.3±6.1 days. It was found that early decannulation significantly reduced patient decannulation and hospitalization time.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens in hospitals, and the most frequent cause of nosocomial infections. Nosocomial staphylococcal foreign-body infections related to biofilm formation are a serious threat, demanding new therapeutic and preventive strategies. Implantation of intravenous catheters and surgical implantation of prosthetic implants carry a risk of infection. In order to prevent all these effects of biofilms, a study was designed to observe the possible antibacterial effect of sumach (Rhus coriaria) on the biofilm formation of S. aureus. Material and Methods: The influence of varying concentrations of sumach on the formation of biofilms by 13 strains of Staphylococcus aureus was tested by a microelisa assay. Results: The significant differences between varying concentrations of sumach (0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 μl/ml) were observed in four methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and nine methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (p<0.05). In bacteria, a dose-related decrease in the formation of slime, which is a major virulence factor of staphylococcal infections, was observed. Conclusion: In our study, using 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 μl/ml of sumach, thirteen strains lost, 17%, 22%, 28% and 48% respectively of their capacity to produce biofilms.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of process and outcome surveillance on rates of device-associated health care-associated infections (DA-HAI) in an intensive care unit (ICU) in Turkey over a four-year period. Material and Methods: An open label, prospective cohort, active DA-HAI surveillance study was conducted on 685 patients admitted to the ICU of a university hospital in Turkey from January 2004 to December 2007, implementing the methodology developed by the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium. DA-HAI rates were recorded according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) definitions. We analyzed the rates of DA-HAI, mechanical ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLA-BSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), as well as microorganism profile, extra length of stay, and hand hygiene compliance. Pooled DA-HAI rates were calculated and compared by year. Results: The DA-HAI rate per 100 patients declined as follows: for 2004, the DA-HAI rate was 58.4%; for 2005, it was 38.9%; for 2006, it was 34.8%; and for 2007, it was 10.9%. The DA-HAI rate per 1,000 bed-days also declined: for 2004, it was 42.8, and for 2007 it was 10.7. The rates decreased from 25.8 to 13.4 for VAP; from 29.9 to 25.0 for CLA-BSI; and from 9.2 to 6.2 for CAUTI cases per 1,000 device-days during the study period. Conclusion: Process and outcome surveillance of DA-HAI significantly reduced DA-HAI.",

Methods: A young male patient with pyoderma gangrenosum of the shin as the first sign of clinically active Crohn's disease, who was treated with Adalimumab, is herein presented. Results: Almost complete healing of the lesion was achieved after 12 weeks of treatment. Conclusions: Successful treatment outcome suggests that Adalimumab is not only a therapeutic option for Crohn's disease but may also be a safe and effective therapy for Pyoderma gangrenosum associated with the disease.
