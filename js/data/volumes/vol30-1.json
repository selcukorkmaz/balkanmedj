The proof was obtained in the early 1950's by work initiated by Rita Levi-Montalcini (RLM) discovering the nerve growth factor (NGF). Today, NGF and its relatives, collectively designated neurotrophins, are well recognized as mediators of multiple biological phenomena in health and disease, ranging from the neurotrophic through immunotrophic and epitheliotrophic to metabotrophic effects. Consequently, NGF and other neurotrophins are implicated in the pathogenesis of a large spectrum of neuronal and non-neuronal diseases, from Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases to atherosclerosis and other cardiometabolic diseases. Recent studies demonstrated the therapeutic potentials of NGF in these diseases, including ocular and cutaneous diseases. Furthermore, NGF TrkA receptor antagonists emerged as novel drugs for pain, prostate and breast cancer, melanoma, and urinary bladder syndromes.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. We aimed to investigate the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) level and MMP-9 gene polymorphism in sleep apnea patients with or without cardiovascular disease. Study Design: Case-control study. Material and Methods: Two hundred nine patients [Mean age (±SD), 47 (±12) yrs; M/F, 170/39] diagnosed with sleep-disordered breathing were included in the study. Serum MMP-9 level was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and MMP-9 gene polymorphism with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. We divided the patient group into two subgroups: (1) patients with confirmed cardiovascular disease, i.e. CV-P Group and (2) patients without cardiovascular disease, CV-N Group. We compared all parameters between the two groups. Results: There were 56 OSAS patients with cardiovascular disorder (CV-positive group) and 153 OSAS patients without cardiovascular disorder (CVnegative group). CC, CT and TT genotype distributions between groups were similar [31 (55%), 25 (45%), 0 (0%) vs 88 (57%), 61 (40%), 4 (3%); respectively, p>0.05]. MMP-9 level was significantly higher in CV-P patients (442.7±139.3 pg/mL) than in CV-N patients (364.4±165.0 pg/mL; p=0.0018).

Conclusion: Our observations emphasise the need to conduct expanded sero-epidemiological investigations of the populations most affected by mumps and to immunise susceptible individuals.",

Study Design: Double blind randomized controlled trial. Material and Methods: The baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was determined, PFT was performed and blood was taken for analysis of TNF- alpha in patients with MS exacerbation. Patients were randomly divided into two groups; group 1 received intravenous methylprednisolone+IV theophylline and group 2 intravenous methylprednisolone+placebo for 5 days. PFT and EDSS score were repeated and blood was taken for TNF-alpha on the 5th and 30th days of the treatment. Results: Twenty-four patients (14 female, 10 male) were included in the study. Mean age was 32.6±9, duration of disease was 5.4±4.2 years, number of exacerbations was 5±2. There was a significant correlation between the number of exacerbations and EDSS score (p=0.000, r=1). Restrictive PFT findings were detected in 8 and decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) in 3 cases. In within-group analysis, EDSS score was found to be decreased on day 5 and still low on day 30 in the theophylline group (baseline 3±1.3; 5th day 2.4±1.6; 30th day 2±1.7). There was no statistically significant difference in the EDSS score of the placebo group (3±1.6; 2.8±1.7; 2.4±1.9 respectively). While serum TNF-alpha level was not changed in the placebo group, there was a non-significant decrease on day 5 and increase on day 30 in the theophylline group. There was no correlation between the clinical parameters, PFT and TNF-alpha level. Conclusion: There was no correlation between severity of MS and PFT findings. It is suggested that theophylline might be effective in MS exacerbations since it caused decreases in clinical scores; studies with longer treatment duration are needed to clarify its possible anti-inflammatory effect.",

Study Design: Prospective follow-up study. Material and Methods: A total of 56 kidney recipients were monitored at 1st, 6th and 12th months for the development of anti-HLA antibodies using bead based flow-cytometry assays (Flow PRA tests). Results: In 21 (37.5%) patients, panel reactive antibodies (PRA) was positive after transplantation, however, in 35 (62.5%) patients PRA was found negative. Twelve (57.1%) patients with post-transplantation HLA-reactive antibodies [PRA (+)] and 8 (22.9%) patients with no detectable alloantibodies [PRA (-)] were developed allograft rejection (p=0.010). In the PRA positive patient group the rates of early period infection and delayed graft function (DGF) were higher than the PRA negative patient group. Serum creatinine levels of PRA positive group at 6. and 12. months after transplantation were significantly higher than the PRA negative group (p=0.015 and p=0.048, respectively). The rejection rates of patients who had class I and II HLA antibodies were significantly higher than the patients who had either class I or II HLA antibodies (p=0.011). Acute rejection rates were significantly higher in patients who had class I and II HLA antibodies at the first month (p=0.007). Conclusion: Higher occurrence of rejection episodes in PRA positive group may show the importance of anti-HLA antibody monitoring using Flow-PRA after renal transplantation as a prognostic marker in terms of graft survival.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of massage to the sacral region after cesarean delivery instead of employing a urinary catheter for the prevention of urinary retention. Study Design: Cross sectional study. Material and Methods: This interventional study population consisted of 60 women who were divided into two intervention groups and one control group. For the first intervention group, the sacral region was massaged every hour 10-15 minutes after cesarean delivery and every 30 minutes after a voiding sensation for the second intervention group. No interventions were made in the control group, although routine hospital services were provided. Socio-demographic data were collected using a questionnaire developed by the researchers. Other data were collected via observation. Results: Fifteen percent (15%) of the women in the first intervention group needed to void 2 hours after cesarean delivery, 35% after 3 hours, and the mean time to void after delivery was 3.4±0.8 hours. Forty percent (40%) of the women in the second intervention group needed to void after 5 hours, and the mean time to void after delivery was 5.5±0.8 hours. Sixty percent (60%) of the women in the control group needed to void 6 hours later, and the mean time to void after delivery was 6.2±0.7 hours. Urinary retention was not observed in the first intervention group. Our statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the three groups in terms of mean times to void after cesarean delivery (p<0.05). Conclusion: In order to facilitate voiding and to prevent urinary retention, which is seen as a post-cesarean complication, massaging the sacral region could be recommended instead of urinary catheter insertion.

    "previewText": "Abstract Objective: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of massage to the sacral region after cesarean delivery instead of employing a urinary catheter for the prevention of urinary retention. Study Design: Cross sectional study. Material and Methods: This interventional study population consisted of 60 women who were divided into two intervention groups and one control group. For the first intervention group, the sacral region was massaged every hour 10-15 minutes after cesarean delivery and every 30 minutes after a voiding sensation for the second intervention group. No interventions were made in the control group, although routine hospital services were provided. Socio-demographic data were collected using a questionnaire developed by the researchers. Other data were collected via observation. Results: Fifteen percent (15%) of the women in the first intervention group needed to void 2 hours after cesarean delivery, 35% after 3 hours, and the mean time to void after delivery was 3.4±0.8 hours. Forty percent (40%) of the women in the second intervention group needed to void after 5 hours, and the mean time to void after delivery was 5.5±0.8 hours. Sixty percent (60%) of the women in the control group needed to void 6 hours later, and the mean time to void after delivery was 6.2±0.7 hours. Urinary retention was not observed in the first intervention group. Our statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the three groups in terms of mean times to void after cesarean delivery (p<0.05). Conclusion: In order to facilitate voiding and to prevent urinary retention, which is seen as a post-cesarean complication, massaging the sacral region could be recommended instead of urinary catheter insertion. Additional studies with larger groups are also recommended.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Functional Living Index Emesis (FLIE) is developed to evaluate the relationship between emesis and it's effects on patient's daily life and is far more relevant to detect the effectiveness of antiemetic treatment compared with self-diary reports. In this study, the efficacy of oral neurokinin-1 antagonist aprepitant on the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and quality of life is evaluated with FLIE. Study Design: Cross sectional study. Material and Methods: Sixty patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) receiving a chemotherapy regimen consisting of Cisplatin and Docetaxel were evaluated. The patients were prospectively randomized to two groups before the first cycle of chemotherapy. Patients in Group A (31 patients) received 3 daily doses of aprepitant along with oral ondansetron and dexamethasone. The patients in group B (29 patients) received only ondansetron and dexamathasone. The efficacy of both regimens was evaluated by a modified Turkish version of FLIE scale consisting of 18 questions. Results: The number of patients with complete response was 31 in the whole group. Of these 18 patients (58%) were in Group A (Aprepitant) and 13 patients in group B (42%). Median FLIE score in group A was 24.97 (±12.45) while it was 38.1 (±26.987) in group B and the difference was statistically significant (p=0.022).

Conclusion: Regarding these findings, it is certain to state that aprepitant in combination with other drugs optimizes protection against both nausea and vomiting compared to the prior standard of care, and must be recommended as first-line therapy for patients who are treated with moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To assess the prevalence of medication and nutritional supplement use in male Football Super League players and to observe the long term changes of players' attitudes during 5 years period (4 seasons). Study Design: Retrospective study. Material and Methods: Review and analysis of 4176 doping control forms -declaration reports- about players' medication intake including; Super League, UEFA Cup and the UEFA Champions League matches. Team physician was asked to document all medications and nutritional supplements taken by the Football Super League players in the last 72 hours before each match. Results: A total intake of 5939 substances were documented, of which almost half 49.2% (n=2921) were classified as medications and 50.8% (n=3018) were nutritional supplements. The average consumption per player was 1.42 substance/match; 0.70 were medications and 0.72 of nutritional supplements. The supplements used most frequently were NSAIDs 24.6% (n=1460) accounting for almost one in four of all reported supplements. Diclofenac Sodium was the most frequently reported active pharmaceutical ingredient. Second most frequently used supplements were vitamins (22.2%). The average drug consumption reported per player has been increasing every passing year. It was 0.7 substance/match/player (0.4 medication; 0.3 nutritional supplement) in 2003-2004 season; was increased to 1.8 substance/match (0.8 medication; 1.0 nutritional supplement) in 2006-2007 season. Conclusion: The trends seen in this survey point to an overuse of NSAIDs and vitamins in comparison with other medications, amoung Turkish Super League football players (p<0.001). The use of NSAIDs has increased but the medication groups did not differ significantly between seasons, in terms of distribution. This increasing use of medications especially of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and nutritional supplements is alarming and needs to be argued.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Objective: To assess the prevalence of medication and nutritional supplement use in male Football Super League players and to observe the long term changes of players' attitudes during 5 years period (4 seasons). Study Design: Retrospective study. Material and Methods: Review and analysis of 4176 doping control forms -declaration reports- about players' medication intake including; Super League, UEFA Cup and the UEFA Champions League matches. Team physician was asked to document all medications and nutritional supplements taken by the Football Super League players in the last 72 hours before each match. Results: A total intake of 5939 substances were documented, of which almost half 49.2% (n=2921) were classified as medications and 50.8% (n=3018) were nutritional supplements. The average consumption per player was 1.42 substance/match; 0.70 were medications and 0.72 of nutritional supplements. The supplements used most frequently were NSAIDs 24.6% (n=1460) accounting for almost one in four of all reported supplements. Diclofenac Sodium was the most frequently reported active pharmaceutical ingredient. Second most frequently used supplements were vitamins (22.2%). The average drug consumption reported per player has been increasing every passing year. It was 0.7 substance/match/player (0.4 medication; 0.3 nutritional supplement) in 2003-2004 season; was increased to 1.8 substance/match (0.8 medication; 1.0 nutritional supplement) in 2006-2007 season. Conclusion: The trends seen in this survey point to an overuse of NSAIDs and vitamins in comparison with other medications, amoung Turkish Super League football players (p<0.001). The use of NSAIDs has increased but the medication groups did not differ significantly between seasons, in terms of distribution.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: To determine the correlation between left ventricular mass index and calcium metabolism in patients with essential hypertension. Study Design: Cross sectional case-control study. Material and Methods: Twenty-seven patients with essential hypertension and 20 healthy individuals were compared with respect to calciotropic hormones, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and urinary and serum biochemical parameters. The correlations between parathormone, vitamin D, and calcitonin levels and LVMI and blood pressure elevation were determined. Results: The parathormone level was significantly higher (p=0.006) and vitamin D level was significantly lower (p=0.01) in the patient group compared with the control group. However, the two groups were similar in terms of albumin-corrected calcium levels, which were within the normal range (p=0.988). The serum sodium (p=0.014) and urinary calcium (p=0.003) levels and LVMI (p<0.01) were also significantly higher in the patient group. No significant correlations were determined between ambulatory blood pressure and parathormone and vitamin D levels, but a significant correlation was found between LVMI and parathormone level (p=0.06) in hypertensive patients. Conclusion: Essential hypertension alters calcium metabolism, causing calciuresis by hypernatremia. Parathormone release increases to compensate for this, and leads to protein synthesis, which in turn provokes the development of myocardial hypertrophy.",

The streptozotocin-induced diabetic rodent is the most commonly used animal model of diabetes and increased sodium channel expression and activity were revealed in this model. At this study, we evaluated the effect of three different nafimidone derivatives which have possible anticonvulsant activity on disorders of thermal pain sensation in diabetic mice. Study Design: Randomized animal experiment. Material and Methods: Mice were divided randomly into five groups (5 mice per group): Control, Diabetes, Dibetes+C1, Diabetes+C2, Diabetes+C3. We used hot and cold plate, and tail-immersion tests for assessment of thermal nociceptive responses. Results: Compared with the control group, the hot-plate response time and the number of paw liftings on cold plate as important indicators of loss of sensation increased, but no significant difference (p>0.05) was found in tail-immersion response time test in diabetes group. C3 compound moved it back to control group levels in the all of three tests. C1 and C2 compounds were effective only in cold-plate test. Conclusion: Nafimidone derivatives may be effective in the cases where epilepsy and diabetes occur together since it has shown efficacy against “loss of sensation” which evolves in diabetic neuropathy over time as well as its antiepileptic effect.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Objective: Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a common complication in Diabetes Mellitus. The streptozotocin-induced diabetic rodent is the most commonly used animal model of diabetes and increased sodium channel expression and activity were revealed in this model. At this study, we evaluated the effect of three different nafimidone derivatives which have possible anticonvulsant activity on disorders of thermal pain sensation in diabetic mice. Study Design: Randomized animal experiment. Material and Methods: Mice were divided randomly into five groups (5 mice per group): Control, Diabetes, Dibetes+C1, Diabetes+C2, Diabetes+C3. We used hot and cold plate, and tail-immersion tests for assessment of thermal nociceptive responses. Results: Compared with the control group, the hot-plate response time and the number of paw liftings on cold plate as important indicators of loss of sensation increased, but no significant difference (p>0.05) was found in tail-immersion response time test in diabetes group. C3 compound moved it back to control group levels in the all of three tests. C1 and C2 compounds were effective only in cold-plate test. Conclusion: Nafimidone derivatives may be effective in the cases where epilepsy and diabetes occur together since it has shown efficacy against “loss of sensation” which evolves in diabetic neuropathy over time as well as its antiepileptic effect.",

We aimed to investigate the effects of erythropoietin (EPO) and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) on MTX-induced lung injury in rats. Study Design: Animal experiment. Material and Methods: Twenty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups. Sham group, 0.3 mL saline; MTX group, 5 mg/kg MTX; EPO group, 5mg/kg MTX and 2000 IU/kg EPO; NAC group, 5 mg/kg MTX and 200 mg/kg NAC were administered once daily for 4 consecutive days. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and inflammation and congestion scores in lung tissues were evaluated. Results: In MTX group MDA were significantly higher, CAT and SOD were significantly lower than in sham, EPO and NAC groups (p<0.005). In EPO group MDA, CAT, and SOD were higher, but not significant than those in group NAC (p>0.005). In group MTX both scores were significantly higher than in sham (p<0.005). The congestion score of group MTX was significantly higher than those of group EPO and NAC (p<0.005). Conclusion: EPO and NAC have significant preventive effects on MTX-induced lung injury in rats. Decreased antioxidant capacity and increased MDA level may cause the oxidative damage in MTX group. Also, higher antioxidant capacity and lower MDA level may be a response to oxidative stress in EPO and NAC groups.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Trace elements such as manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) play key roles in metabolic reactions and are important in many physiological enzymatic processes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the acute effects of moderate and strenuous running (treadmill) exercise on the levels of Mn, Co and Cr in the brain, liver, and spleen of trained rats. Study Design: Animal experiment. Material and Methods: Twenty-one Wistar-Albino adult male rats were used in the study. Rats were grouped as control group (no mandated exercise; n=8), moderate exercise group (30 min exercise duration; n=7), and strenuous exercise group (60 min exercise duration; n=6). The levels of Mn, Co, and Cr in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, brain stem, liver, and spleen were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results: Cr levels in liver of rats increased in parallel to the time course of running supporting the exercise training effect on the action of insulin. Compared to the control group, the level of Co significantly decreased in the brain stem of rats in the moderate exercise group (p=0.009) and in the frontal lobe of rats in the strenuous exercise group (p=0.004). In the strenuous exercise group, an examination of the brain stem revealed that the level of Mn significantly decreased (p=0.001), and levels of Co and Cr were apparently depleted to the extent that these elements were no longer detectable. Conclusion: A notable finding is that during or after single bout strenuous exercise, levels of Co decreased in the spleen and particularly decreased in the brain stem of regularly trained rats. From this study, it can be inferred that sportsmen should aware trace element disturbances among the body parts or depletion of some trace elements after single bout of chronic strenuous running exercise.",

This paper reports a case of leptospirosis in Pleven, Bulgaria, in which the subject was infected after wading through irrigative canal in northern Greece. Two days later, he had a fever, myalgia and vomiting followed by jaundice, darkness of urine and oliguria. The patient was admitted to Clinic of Infectious Diseases at University Hospital-Pleven after returning to Bulgaria. The history and laboratory findings suggested icterohaemorrhagic leptospirosis. Penicillin G was prescribed and intensive supportive treatment was initiated. Dialysis was performed two hours after admission and was followed by poliuric stage of acute renal failure (peak urine output 16 600 mL/day). Microaglutination test (MAT) for sero-diagnosis was positive (L. hardjo 1:1600, L. icterohaemorrhagiae 1:800). The patient was discharged after sixteen days with improved renal and liver functions. In conclusion, The probability of leptospirosis should not be ignored in patients with fever after returning from abroad. The prompt dialysis and adequate treatment improve prognosis.",
