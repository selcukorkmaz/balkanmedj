    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: This study was planned to evaluate the results of surgical and medical treatment in descending aortic dissections. Patients and Methods: The study included 22 patients presented with DeBakey type III dissection between January 1999 and March 2002. While 11 patients (8 males, 3 females; mean age 56.6±11.9) were treated surgically, 11 patients (10 males, 1 female; mean age 72.8±7.7) were followed up by medical therapy. Patients operated and patients followed up with medical treatment were called and evaluated for pain history, physical examination signs, and thoracoabdominal computed tomography with 6-month intervals. Results: Of surgically treated patients, two had acute descending aortic rupture, nine had acute type III dissection unresponsive to medical therapy. Seven patients died (63.6%). Comorbid diseases, excessive bleeding during the operation and blood transfusion, cross clamp time and development of low cardiac output were found to be the causes of high mortality. Although early results in surgical group were poor, late results in surgical and medical groups were similar. In the follow-up (6-28 months) of medically treated patients distal organ ischemia or aortic diameter increase were seen, there were no complications or mortality. Conclusion: Type III dissection is a disease with high mortality and morbidity. Patients' response to medical therapy were found to be good.",

Patients and Methods: The anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of 60 intertrochanteric hip fractures were reviewed and classified by two groups (G1, G2) of orthopaedic surgeons using the AO and Jensen classification systems on two separate occasions three months apart. Each group consisted of five orthopaedic surgeons. Group 1 had less than five years, and group 2 had more than 10 years of experience. Kappa statistical analysis was used for determination of intra- and interobserver variation. Results: For the AO classification system without subgroups, the mean kappa value was 0.67 (range 0.47-0.90) for intraobserver variation and 0.42 (range 0.10-0.73) for interobserver variation. For the Jensen classification, the mean kappa value was 0.57 (range 0.35-0.80) for intraobserver variation and 0.30 (range 0.10-0.60) for interobserver variation. For the AO classification system with subgroups, the mean kappa value was 0.49 (range 0.21-0.81) for intraobserver variation and 0.23 (range 0.09-0.51) for interobserver variation. Conclusion: Although these classification systems have disadvantages, this study suggests that AO system without subgroups is more useful than Jensen and AO system with subgroups to classify intertrochanteric fractures of the proximal femur.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: To evaluate the clinical signs and symptoms, diagnosis-treatments, distributions and outcomes of patients with intracranial complications due to chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). Patients and Methods: Data of 42 patients (27 males, 15 gemales; mean age 31.3 years; range 9 to 74 years) diagnosed as intracranial complication due to CSOM were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were investigated on the basis of age, sex, symptoms, findings of otoscopic examination, complications, radiological evaluations, methods of management and findings at the operation. Results: Complications occurred predominantly in patients between 31 and 40 years of age (33.3%). Severe headache, nausea-vomiting, otalgia, purulent otorrhea and fever were the most common signs and symptoms. Meningitis was the most common (15 patients, 35.7%), brain abscess (14 patients, 33.3%) and lateral sinus thrombosis (10 patients, 23.8%) were second and third common complications. The overall mortality rate was 2.4% (in one patient who was comatose on admission), whereas it was 7.1% for patients with brain abscess. Conclusion: Intracranial complications of CSOM are still a serious problem due to life-threatening condition. If a patient with active CSOM has severe headache, nausea-vomiting, otalgia and fever, otogenic intracranial complication should be considered, and detailed evaluation should be performed for early diagnosis since the level of consciousness on admission is an important prognostic factor.",

Patients having cottage cheese-like discharge, vaginal pH<4.5, Whiff test (-) were accepted as mycotic vaginitis. To determine mycotic agents in vaginal discharge, samples were cultured in Sabouraud glucose agar. As a treatment, patients were administered a single-dose of 300 mg sertaconazole nitrate ovule.

Patients were treated with specific physical therapy and rehabilitation programs. Clinical and electrophysiological evaluation were done at the beginning, every four months within the first year, and every year after two years. All patients completed 24 months, and 19 patients completed 36 months of follow-up. Results: In 12 (52%) patients, needle electromyography (EMG) findings returned to normal at the second EMG examination. Only four (21%) patients had abnormal EMG findings at the end of the study period. In 13 (56%) patients, muscle strength became normal within four months, and it became normal in 17 (74%) patients within the first year. Progressive muscle weakness was not observed in any patient during the study. At the end of the study, excellent or good functional outcome were obtained in 15 (79%) patients. Conclusion: Myotomal muscle weakness resulting from cervical disk herniation is usually caused by a neuropraxic lesion at the root level.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the range of motion (ROM) of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in males and in females by using digital inclinometer and its correlation with the interincisial distance. Patients and Methods: One hundred and five healthy (50 males, 55 females) volunteers who were studying at our university participated in this study. Maximum opening, right-left excursion and protraction degrees were determined with electronic digital inclinometer which was extremely sensitive but practicable. Besides, interincisial distance was measured by using vernier caliper during maximum mouth opening. Results: The average values for males and females were found as follows: maximum mouth opening 30.58º, 27.16º; right excursion 4.96º, 6.85º; left excursion 5.40º, 7.43º and protraction 13.38º, 11.85º, respectively. Interincisial distances were measured as 52.4 mm in males and 52.2 mm in females. Conclusion: The evaluation of ROM values for the TMJ are important in the diagnostic and treatment of the musculoskeletal and neurological diseases affecting joint movement. We conclude that interincisial distance measurements may be a practical method for the evaluation of the derangements in this joint.",

So in this work we reported a case treated with fasciocutaneous gluteal flap that can be an alternative method for the treatment of resistant cases. A 34-year-old man was admitted to our clinic for chronic pilonidal sinus disease. The patient had a history of an excision of pilonidal tractus and drainage operation five years before and irregularly used antibiotheraphy after that. All sinus tracts were excised widely and the defect was repaired with fasciocutaneous flap prepared from bilateral gluteal region. Postoperative course of the patient was uneventful and hemovac drains were withdrawn after cessation of drainage. The patient was mobilized at the postoperative 2nd day. As a result; although bilateral fasciocutaneous gluteal flap is not the first alternative for the treatment of pilonidal disease, it can be valuable in treating the patients with wide, recurrent, and vertically long pilonidal disease.",

Classical treatment option of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome of childhood is steroid. Although 90% of patients respond to steroid treatment, 80-90% of patients relapse during follow-up and 25-45% of patients become frequent relapser, half of which progresses to steroid-dependent. Steroid-dependent and frequent relapser children are under risk of steroid toxicity. Successful treatment with levamisole is reported in the current literature, when steroids fail and/or toxicity occurs. According to these findings, we treated three frequent relapser and two steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome patients with levamisole for six months. Other than one of the frequent relapsers who did not respond, number of the attacks and cumulative steroid dosage significantly decreased in all. As a result; we think that using cheap and effective levamisole with less adverse effects in frequent relapser and steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome increases the remission rate and duration, and also prevents the adverse effects of other immunosuppressives.",
