    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The ideal prophylaxis duration for transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy is incompletely defined. Aims: To compare the infectious complications of transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy with and without extended antibiotic prophylaxis. The secondary aim was to evaluate the risk factors for infectious complications. Study Design: Prospective observational study. Methods: Four hundred patients who underwent transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy were recruited. Patients orally received either 750 mg ciprofloxacin 60 min before the procedure or 500 mg ciprofloxacin twice a day for a duration of 7 days with the initial dose administered 24 h prior to the procedure. All patients were followed-up for 4 weeks after the transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy procedure for infectious complications. Screening of urine was carried out in all patients on the 3rd and 7th day after the procedure. Medical histories of all patients were collected prior to biopsy. Information on medical history include the following: hospitalization, urethral catheterization, or urinary tract infections within the past 12 months; antibiotic use within the last 3 months, prior urinary tract interventions, and previous transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy and Charlson comorbidity indexes. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was carried out using General Electric’s 7 MHz transrectal ultrasound device in the left decubitus position. Patients received one of the two ciprofloxacin-based prophylaxis regimens. Subsequent transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy to all patients were followed-up for 30 days. Further follow-up of patients was carried out on the second and fourth weeks after transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy, and symptoms, such as dysuria, rectal bleeding, fever, hematospermia, hematuria, and pollakiuria, were recorded. Results: Both groups presented similar baseline characteristics and medical history. Infectious complication rates within the 4-week follow-up were similar in both groups (single dose: 3% vs prolonged: 3%) (p>0.05). In both groups, infectious complications significantly increased than that at previous antibiotic usage (single: p=0.028; prolonged: p=0.040). Non-infectious complication ratios showed no significant variation (p>0.05). Conclusion: Pre-operative single dose of 750 mg oral ciprofloxacin compared with 7 days prolonged treatment resulted in similar infectious complication outcomes in patients undergoing transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy. The use of antibiotics within the last 3 months increases the risk for post-transrectal ultrasonography-guided prostate biopsy infectious complications.",

The allele and genotype distributions of this variant were comparable between patients and controls in all subjects and between genders (all p>0.05).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a potentially life-threatening condition. Although the introduction of therapeutic plasma exchange has reduced mortality rates from over 90% to 10%-20%, approximately 40% of patients relapse, and outcomes may be fatal in refractory patients. There is clearly a need for additional therapeutic approaches. Aims: To describe the outcomes of relapsed/refractory thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura patients treated with vincristine as an adjunct to therapeutic plasma exchange.Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The medical records of all relapsed/refractory patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura treated with vincristine adjunct to therapeutic plasma exchange between October 2000 and December 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was based on clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory examinations. Patient demographics, laboratory findings, initial date and duration of therapeutic plasma exchange, dosage and time of administration of vincristine, and outcomes were recorded. Results: The study included 15 patients [median age: 37 years (range: 26-65); 7 women and 8 men] with either relapsed or refractory thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura who were treated with vincristine as an adjunct to therapeutic plasma exchange for a total of 22 episodes. Eighty-seven percent of patients achieved remissions in 20 of 22 episodes, with a median duration of remission of 29.5 months (range: 3-105). After a median follow-up of 55 months, 11 patients were alive. Vincristine was well tolerated with no safety concerns.Conclusion: Vincristine offers a reasonable option for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Further studies evaluating vincristine in the front-line setting and in the relapsed/refractory setting are needed to validate the role of vincristine in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura patients.",

Aims: To evaluate the natural course of type IIa hips using Graf’s own perspective of physiological immaturity and maturational deficit.Study Design: A single center, retrospective cohort study.Methods: This was an institutional review board-approved retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with type IIa hip dysplasia at a single institution from 2012 to 2014.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Chronic renal failure, particularly end-stage renal disease, is a serious health problem associated with a high mortality rate. Uremic syndrome leads to increased oxidative stress, inflammation, and dyslipidemia. Aims: To examine superoxide dismutase isoenzyme gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients on hemodialysis and to determine the associations between superoxide dismutase isoenzyme gene expression, oxidative stress, and non-enzymatic antioxidative protection. Study Design: Case control study. Methods: This study included 33 patients on hemodialysis (age, 55.33±15.31 years old) and 33 apparently healthy controls (age, 45.37±8.92 years old). Superoxide dismutase isoenzyme messenger ribonucleic acid levels were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. General biochemical parameters, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, total antioxidant status, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and the superoxide anion radical were also determined. Results: Normalized Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and Mn superoxide dismutase messenger ribonucleic acid levels were significantly higher in patients than controls (p<0.001 and p=0.011). A significant negative correlation was detected between normalized Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase messenger ribonucleic acid levels and total protein, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total antioxidant status. Normalized Mn superoxide dismutase messenger ribonucleic acid levels were negatively correlated with total protein and total antioxidant status. A multiple regression analysis revealed independent associations between total antioxidant status and normalized Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (p=0.038) and between total antioxidant status and normalized Mn superoxide dismutase messenger ribonucleic acid levels (p=0.038 and p=0.018, respectively). Conclusion: The superoxide dismutase isoenzyme gene is expressed at a higher rate in patients with end-stage renal failure, probably due to increased oxidative stress and attenuated antioxidative defense.

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims: This descriptive survey was to evaluate the use of regional anesthesia in obstetrics in Greek public hospitals.Methods: The survey was conducted between March and August 2016. A structured questionnaire was sent to 50 anesthesia departments in Greek public hospitals with obstetric units. Results: The response rate was 94%. Data corresponding to 9475 cesarean and 8155 vaginal deliveries were collected. Regional anesthesia was used in 69.2% of all cesareans, with single shot spinal being the most popular (44.3% of all cesareans). Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was used in 18.1% of all cesareans (35.1% in hospitals of Athens versus 7.9% outside Athens, p<0.001). Post-cesarean analgesia was applied with simple analgesics and systematic opioids (78.6%). Long-acting spinal opioids were rarely used (4.4% of spinal and spinal/epidurals). Labor epidural analgesia was applied in 19.1% of all vaginal deliveries (30.3% in Athens versus 13.1% outside Athens, p<0.001). Paracetamol and pethidine represented the standard labor analgesics in 48.9% and 55.3% of all hospitals. Intravenous remifentanil was used in 10.6% of hospitals (50% in Athens versus 2.5% outside Athens, p=0.002). In 48.9% of hospitals, mainly outside Athens, the anesthesiologists did not get involved in labor analgesia.Conclusion: Regional anesthesia is the most common practice for cesareans in Greek public hospitals; however, the percentage of general anesthesia remains high. In addition, the use of labor epidural analgesia is limited in hospitals outside Athens.",
