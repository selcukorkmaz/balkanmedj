Cell count, viability, and flow cytometry studies were done at every passage after completing detachment in the cultures. Results: 10% OS group was found to be superior compared to the other study groups as regard to cell count and isolation.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro effects of dopamine on internal thoracic artery (ITA) graft. Material and Methods: Between December 2003- June 2005, 32 patients (2 women and 30 men, mean age; 59.26±8.34, range 37-75 years old) who were subjected to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) operation in our clinic were enrolled in this study. ITA remnants were suspended in an isolated organ bath. Constrictor or relaxant responses to dopamine were recorded isometrically. Results: Dopamine in the concentration range of 10-9 M-10-7 M produced a mild relaxant effect on phenylephrine-precontracted ITA, and at higher concentrations than 10-7 M it produced a constrictor response. Ther relaxant effect of dopamine was partially antagonized by L-NAME (nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 10-6 M), propranolol (10-6 M), and cis-α-flupenthixol (dopaminergic receptor antagonist, 10-6 M), but not by metoclopramide (D2-dopaminergic receptor antagonist). The constrictor effect of dopamine was partially antagonized by phentolamine, prazosin and, yohimbine. Conclusion: It was concluded that, while dopamine produces a vasodilator response at the lower concentrations, it causes a constrictor effect on ITA at the higher concentrations. Both a β-adrenergic and a nitric oxide mediated mechanism (via D1-dopaminergic receptor) may play a role in the relaxant effect of dopamine on ITA at the lower concentrations. Constrictor response to dopamine at the higher concentrations on ITA may be produced by the activation of α1- and α2-adrenergic receptors.",

Material and Methods: Participant patients were those who presented at our hospital with seizures caused by B12 vitamin deficiency. Evaluation was based on clinical, physical and neurological signs of the patients. Complete hemogram, peripheral blood view, vitamin B12 level and folic acid level measurements were performed. Cerebral magnetic resonance scans and interictal EEG were performed on all patients. Results: The participant patients were 5 males (66.7%) and 2 females (33.3%) consecutively. The types of seizures were generalized tonic clonic in 4, generalized tonic in one and partial in 2 of the cases. 2 of 3 patient had generalized epileptic activity and the other had focal activity on EEG examination. One of the participants presented with status epilepticus. The median vitamin B12 levels of the cases and their mothers were 59.14±22.04 (30-96) and 140.43±23.89 (119-170) pg/mL consecutively at laboratory findings.

We aimed to investigate the possible relationship between vitiligo pathogenesis and the change of antioxidant capacity of skin and plasma in patients with vitiligo. Material and Methods: In this study we have examined normal and vitiliginous skin and plasma GPx, SOD and CAT activities by spectrophotometric methods in 40 vitiligo patients and 15 controls. Results: Results of tissue enzyme activities (as U/mg prt and Mean±SD); were 0.64±0.09; 0.89±0.15; 0.41±0.57 for SOD enzyme, 170.98±12.35; 182.13±13.48; 121.91+16.03 for GPx enzyme and 78.92±10.34; 94.99±10+47; 55.95±7.24 for CAT enzyme in involved skin, uninvolved skin and control groups respectively.

Material and Methods: The hospital records of 58 newborn infants with respiratory distress who were above 35 weeks of gestational age were investigated. Patients were divided into two groups. The infection group consisted of patients with proven sepsis and clinical sepsis and the other was the TTN group. Clinical findings and white blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6 levels and the ratio of immature neutrophils to total neutrophils count (I/T) were recorded and compared between the two groups. Results: Serum CRP and IL-6 levels were found higher than the normal limits in both of the groups. However there was no significant difference between them. Duration of respiratory distress was longer and I/T ratio significantly higher in the infection group than the TTN group.

Material and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between April and May, 2008 in Sanliurfa's city center. A community-based representative sample (N=1070) was randomly selected using cluster sampling from the catchment areas served by 19 different primary healthcare centers. A questionnaire evaluating demographic information and probable risk factors for HBV and HCV was administered, and HBsAg and anti-HCV markers were analyzed from blood samples. Results: Among the 1070 individuals who participated in the study, 33.1% were male (n=354) and 66.9% female (n=716). The average age was 35.4±13.5 (15-90) years. The seroprevalence of HBsAg positivity was 4.2% (n=45), while anti-HCV seropositivity was found to be 1.0% (n=11). Among participants who previously suffered a known hepatitis infection or who reported a family history of hepatitis, the HBsAg positivity was found to be higher (p<0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between HCV transmission risk factors and anti-HCV positivity. Conclusion: This is the first hepatitis seroprevalence study in central Sanliurfa and demonstrated moderate HBV infection endemicity.",

ThePrP staining index was calculated by counting PrP positive cells per microscopic field after immunostaining.

Results: Varying degrees of PrP expression were detected in histologic samples of the liver in patients with CVH, whereas no staining was observed in control specimens.

Results: The mean age of the patients was 68.2 years. The mean length of hospitalisation stay was 10.4 days. The costs were different between survivors and non-survivors. There was a statistically significant difference between survivors and non-survivors groups in all costs except bed costs, laboratory costs, radiology costs and consultation costs.

The aim of this study was to examine the costs of acute exacerbation of COPD patients admitted to two different university hospital intensive care units. Material and Methods: We analyzed 156 patients (128 male and 28 female) who were admitted for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD from January 1, 2005 to June 15, 2008. Results: The mean age of the patients was 68.2 years. The mean length of hospitalisation stay was 10.4 days. The costs were different between survivors and non-survivors. There was a statistically significant difference between survivors and non-survivors groups in all costs except bed costs, laboratory costs, radiology costs and consultation costs. Conclusion: These results suggest that the cost of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD represents a considerable economic burden for the health care system in Turkey.",

There are two types of breast cyst; lined by apocrine epithelium (Na/K<3) or flattened epithelium (Na/K>3). Several studies have shown that women with palpable breast cysts may have 1.7-7.5 times higher risk of developing breast cancer. Patients with malignant disease usually show abnormal amino acid profiles in the peripheral circulation. Changes in amino acid profile diagnostically correlate with organ sites of malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of amino acids in two cyst groups and possible mechanisms involved in the development of breast cancer. Material and Methods: The breast cyst fluid aspirated from women with GCBD were analysed. Breast cyst fluid amino acid levels were determined with HPLC. Results: Aspartic acid, glutamic acid, hydroxyproline, serine, glycine, threonine, alanine, proline, tyrosine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine and tryptophan levels were significantly higher, and lysine levels were lower in the apocrine epithelial cysts. Conclusion: In this study, higher concentrations of amino acids in apocrine cysts, which are also known to have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, may indicate the possible role(s) of amino acids in the mechanism of breast cancer development.",

Coronary artery bypass anastomoses were performed using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and saphenous vein. At the end of the cardiopulmonary bypass, graft flow (ml/min), pulsatility index (PI), flow curve and diastolic filling percentage (DF%) of each graft were assessed with TTFM. Results: Mean graft number of the patients was 3.25±0.8. We assessed the patency of a total of 187 grafts using TTFM. Highest mean flow was 55.5 ml/min in aorta-RCA grafts and lowest mean flow was 37.6 ml/min in aorta-diagonal grafts. Revision was required for two grafts (3.38%) in two patients based on inadequate TTFM findings.

    "previewText": "Abstract Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the coronary artery bypass grafts with Transit Time Flowmeter (TTFM). Material and Methods: Fifty-nine patients who were scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery were included in the study. Coronary artery bypass anastomoses were performed using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and saphenous vein. At the end of the cardiopulmonary bypass, graft flow (ml/min), pulsatility index (PI), flow curve and diastolic filling percentage (DF%) of each graft were assessed with TTFM. Results: Mean graft number of the patients was 3.25±0.8. We assessed the patency of a total of 187 grafts using TTFM. Highest mean flow was 55.5 ml/min in aorta-RCA grafts and lowest mean flow was 37.6 ml/min in aorta-diagonal grafts. Revision was required for two grafts (3.38%) in two patients based on inadequate TTFM findings. Conclusion: Transit time flowmeter is an important technique that provides the detection of technical errors during surgery. With the detection of graft failure intraoperatively, revision of the graft and restoration of blood flow could be performed.",

During routine abdominal dissections, we encountered multivariations of the left gastric artery in a 65 year old male cadaver. The left gastric artery arose from the coeliac trunk as the first branch, afterwards it divided into two branches. The branch which passed to the right side gave three branches; to the left lobe of the liver (an accessory hepatic artery), to the fundus of the stomach and oesophagus, respectively. The branch which passed to the left side divided into two main trunks. The anterior trunk supplied the fundus and anterior wall of the stomach and the posterior trunk supplied the fundus and the posterior wall of the stomach. Consequently the posterior wall of the stomach was supplied by the posterior trunk instead of the posterior gastric artery of the splenic artery.
