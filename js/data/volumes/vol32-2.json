    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Host genetic factors can affect the progress of hepatitis-C virus (HCV) infection. Interleukin-28B (IL28B) single nucleotide polymorphisms may play an important role in the clearance of HCV spontaneously or with treatment. Aims: The aim of our study was to evaluate the rate of IL28B genotypes in patients with Chronic Hepatitis-C (CHC) and healthy control subjects and to examine the characteristics of patients in each IL28B subgroup. Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: IL28B polymorphisms were genotyped by Polymerase Chain Reaction and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in all subjects. Results: The mean age was 52.3±10.9 years (33% female) in the CHC patients and 52.5±11.5 years (39.1% female) in the healthy controls. The percentage of patients with a high baseline viral load (≥400,000 IU/mL) was higher in the CT group (69.8%) compared to the C/C (44.4%) and T/T (50%) groups (p=0.021). There was no significant difference in liver fibrosis and liver necroinflammation distribution among the CC, CT and TT genotypes with mild, moderate and severe groups (p=0.058 and p=0.791, respectively). Mean age, gender ratio, body mass index, viral load at baseline, rate of HCV genotypes, baseline ALT levels were not significantly different among the three IL28B subgroups (p>0.05). A significant increase was observed in the frequencies of IL28B rs12979860 TT genotypes in the CHC patients (20.6%) compared to the healthy control group (8.7%) (p=0.033). Conclusion: In the patients with chronic HCV-genotype 1b and 4 infections, the IL28B rs12979860 (C>T) gene polymorphism frequency of the TT genotype and T allele was higher than in healthy control subjects. This result indicates that the TT genotype may be more effective in the progression of HCV infection than other genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Thyroid cancers are the most frequently occurring endocrine malignancy worldwide. In Turkey, thyroid cancers are ranked 2nd on the incidence list in women, with a rate of 16.2%, but they are not included among the top 10 cancer types in men. Aims: To identify the contribution of the BRAFV600E mutation, and the RET/PTC1 and PAX8-PPARγ rearrangements in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of follicular epithelial-derived thyroid lesions. Study Design: Retrospective clinical and molecular genetic study. Methods: A total of 86 thyroid cases diagnosed between 2001 and 2012 at the Department of Pathology were included in the retrospective study group. Samples best representing the lesion and comprising capsules were chosen in the selection of paraffin blocks pertaining to the cases. The BRAFV600E mutation, and the RET/PTC1 and PAX8-PPARγ rearrangements were investigated in all cases. Results: The BRAFV600E mutation was observed in 12 out of 37 papillary carcinoma cases (32.4%), in 1 out of 15 follicular carcinoma cases (6.6%), and in 1 out of 7 undifferentiated carcinoma cases (14.3%). No mutation was detected in benign lesions. The RET/PTC1 rearrangement was detected in 2 out of 7 undifferentiated carcinoma cases (28.6%), and in 1 out of 15 follicular carcinoma cases (6.6%).

The BRAFV600E mutation was rather specific to papillary carcinoma in the thyroid, and in cases where the BRAFV600E mutation was detected, multi-centricity, lymph node metastasis and capsular invasion findings were observed more frequently compared to cases in which no mutation was observed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Bell’s palsy is the most frequent cause of unilateral facial paralysis. Inflammation is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Bell’s palsy. Aims: Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) are simple and inexpensive tests which are indicative of inflammation and can be calculated by all physicians. The aim of this study was to reveal correlations of Bell’s palsy and degree of paralysis with NLR and PLR. Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: The retrospective study was performed January 2010 and December 2013. Ninety-nine patients diagnosed as Bell’s palsy were included in the Bell’s palsy group and ninety-nine healthy individuals with the same demographic characteristics as the Bell’s palsy group were included in the control group. As a result of analyses, NLR and PLR were calculated. Results: The mean NLR was 4.37 in the Bell’s palsy group and 1.89 in the control group with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). The mean PLR was 137.5 in the Bell’s palsy group and 113.75 in the control group with a statistically significant difference (p=0.008). No statistically significant relation was detected between the degree of facial paralysis and NLR and PLR. Conclusion: The NLR and the PLR were significantly higher in patients with Bell’s palsy. This is the first study to reveal a relation between Bell’s palsy and PLR. NLR and PLR can be used as auxiliary parameters in the diagnosis of Bell’s palsy. JEL code: I180 Health",

S. aureus has a large number of virulence factors. Aims: To investigate the methicillin resistance and frequency of various virulence factors in S. aureus nasal isolates. Study Design: Descriptive study. Methods: Nasal samples collected from university students were cultured in media.

The most important point during intubation of those patients is not to increase the cervical injury. Aims: In this study, we hypothesize that there will be a minimal cervical extension during a laryngoscopy with the use of optical view laryngoscopes. Study Design: Prospective, randomized clinical trial. Methods: One hundred and fifty adult patients with ASA physical status I to III were enrolled in our study. After routine anesthesia induction, we randomly assigned the patients into three groups according to the type of laryngoscope.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Sepsis is a state of augmented oxidative stress and diminished antioxidant capacity. High density lipoprotein (HDL) particles were shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), which is an enzyme that is also protective against HDL oxidation. Previous studies suggested a possible role of decreased PON1 activity or HDL levels in sepsis patients. Aims: The present study was designed to test a hypothesis that higher PON1 activity and HDL-cholesterol levels could predict a better survival in sepsis patients. Study Design: Observational study. Methods: Venous blood samples were collected from sepsis patients for HDL-cholesterol levels, PON1 activity and cytokine assays (TNF-α and IL-6) and Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were calculated in order to weight patients’ disease severity on the day of sepsis diagnosis. Patients were followed-up until the 28th day for any cause intra-hospital mortality. Data were statistically analyzed for effects of study parameters on patients’ survival. Results: In total, 85 patients with sepsis were included in the study. The mean age was 65.2±17.9 years and 48 were male; at the end of the 28-day follow-up period, 46 survived. TNF-α (86.9±10.5 vs 118.6±16.4) and IL-6 levels (906.7±82.7 vs 1323.1±54.3) were significantly higher in non-survivors, while PON1 activity (140.7±42.3 vs 66.7±46.6) and HDL-cholesterol levels (43.6±8.1 vs 34.5±8.9) were significantly higher in survivors (p<0.001 for all). TNF-α (r=-0.763) and IL-6 levels (r=-0.947) showed strong negative correlations, PON1 activity (r=0.644) and HDL-cholesterol levels (r=0.477) showed positive correlations with patient survival (p<0.001 for all). Survival estimates significantly favored TNF-α (Log Rank 59.5, p<0.001) and IL-6 levels (Log Rank 53.2, p<0.001) according to PON1 activity (Log Rank 5.4, p<0.03) and HDL-cholesterol levels (Log Rank 8.3, p<0.005). Regression analyses for relative contributions of parameters to survival showed that higher IL-6 levels (t:-16.489, p<0.001) were the most significant negative factor for survival, and TNF-α levels (t:-4.417, p<0.001), whereas PON1 activity had a positive effect (t:3.210, p<0.003). Conclusion: The present study showed that although low PON1 activity and HDL-cholesterol levels were related to mortality, higher levels were not found to be as predictive as cytokine levels for survival.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Background: Sepsis is a state of augmented oxidative stress and diminished antioxidant capacity. High density lipoprotein (HDL) particles were shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), which is an enzyme that is also protective against HDL oxidation. Previous studies suggested a possible role of decreased PON1 activity or HDL levels in sepsis patients. Aims: The present study was designed to test a hypothesis that higher PON1 activity and HDL-cholesterol levels could predict a better survival in sepsis patients. Study Design: Observational study. Methods: Venous blood samples were collected from sepsis patients for HDL-cholesterol levels, PON1 activity and cytokine assays (TNF-α and IL-6) and Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were calculated in order to weight patients’ disease severity on the day of sepsis diagnosis. Patients were followed-up until the 28th day for any cause intra-hospital mortality. Data were statistically analyzed for effects of study parameters on patients’ survival. Results: In total, 85 patients with sepsis were included in the study. The mean age was 65.2±17.9 years and 48 were male; at the end of the 28-day follow-up period, 46 survived. TNF-α (86.9±10.5 vs 118.6±16.4) and IL-6 levels (906.7±82.7 vs 1323.1±54.3) were significantly higher in non-survivors, while PON1 activity (140.7±42.3 vs 66.7±46.6) and HDL-cholesterol levels (43.6±8.1 vs 34.5±8.9) were significantly higher in survivors (p<0.001 for all). TNF-α (r=-0.763) and IL-6 levels (r=-0.947) showed strong negative correlations, PON1 activity (r=0.644) and HDL-cholesterol levels (r=0.477) showed positive correlations with patient survival (p<0.001 for all). Survival estimates significantly favored TNF-α (Log Rank 59.5, p<0.001) and IL-6 levels (Log Rank 53.2, p<0.001) according to PON1 activity (Log Rank 5.4, p<0.03) and HDL-cholesterol levels (Log Rank 8.3, p<0.005).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Alpha lipoic acid is a potent antioxidant that plays numerous roles in human health. This study examined the effect of ALA on rat sciatic nerve ischemia reperfusion damage. Aims: Protective effect of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) on sciatic nerve following ischemia-reperfusion in rats was investigated by using light microscopy and biochemical methods. Provided that the protective effect of ALA on sciatic nerve is proven, we think the damage to the sciatic nerve that has already occurred or might occur in patients for various reasons maybe prevented or stopped by giving ALA in convenient doses. Study Design: Animal experiment. Methods: Forty-two adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 grams) were used in this study. Rats were randomly divided into six groups including one control (Group 1), one sham (Group 2), two ischemia-reperfusion (Groups 3 and 4) and two treatment groups (Groups5 and 6). Doses of 60 and 100 mg/kg ALA were given (Group 5 and 6) intra peritoneally twice, 1 and 24 hours before the ischemia to each treatment group. Ischemia was carried out the abdominal aorta starting from the distal part of the renal vein for two hours followed by reperfusion for three hours. In immunohistochemical methods, fibronectin immunoreactivity was analyzed. For biochemical analyses, the tissues were taken in eppendorf microtubes and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) enzyme activities as well as malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitricoxide (NO) levels were measured. Results: Fibronectin was observed to have increased significantly in the ischemia group; on the other hand, it was observed to have decreased in parallel to the doses in the ALA groups. Biochemical studies showed that SOD and GSHPx declined with ischemia-reperfusion, but the activities of these enzymes were increased in the treatment groups in parallel with the dose. It was found that increased MDA levels with ischemia-reperfusion were decreased in parallel with ALA dose. There were no statistically significant changes in NO. Conclusion: Increased fibronectin observed after ischemia/reperfusion of rat sciatic nerve is reduced after the administration of ALA. This indicates that the function of fibronectin, to reconnect cut nerve segments and regenerate nerves, is more prominent than its function in tissue healing after ischemia. ALA administered before ischemia decreases MDA and increases SOD and GSHPx. We think that ALA may protect against the pathological changes in ischemic nerve and may be used to devise more efficient treatments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Sugammadex has been shown to decrease the efficiency of progesterone-containing oral contraceptive drugs which possess a steroid structure. Aims: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sugammadex on progesterone levels in pregnant rats as well as on the physiological course of the pregnancy. Study Design: Animal experiment. Methods: This study was approved by the Selçuk University Ethical Committee for Experimental Animal Research. Pregnant Winster Albino rats (n=26) were divided into three groups and administered with various intravenous injections on the 7th day of pregnancy. The control group (Group K, n=6) received 1.5 mL serum physiologic, the sugammadex group (Group S, n=10) received 30 mg/kg sugammadex and the sugammadex + rocuronium group (Group SR, n=10) received 30 mg/kg sugammadex and 3.5 mg/kg rocuronium. Progesterone levels were measured and the offspring were monitored for morphologic status. Results: Mean progesterone levels were 94.16±15.54 ng/mL in Group K, 87.86±12.48 ng/mL in Group S, and 94.53±16.10 ng/mL in Group SR (p>0.05). No stillbirth or miscarriage was observed in the rats. The mean number of offspring was 6.8±1.47 in Group K, 6.5±1.35 in Group S, and 6.4±1.17 in Group SR. The offspring appeared macroscopically normal. Conclusion: Sugammadex does not appear to affect the progesterone levels in pregnant rats in the first trimester and the clinical course. Successful completion of pregnancy and the absence of stillbirth or miscarriage will guide future studies about the use of sugammadex, particularly in the first trimester of the pregnancy.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Background: Sugammadex has been shown to decrease the efficiency of progesterone-containing oral contraceptive drugs which possess a steroid structure. Aims: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sugammadex on progesterone levels in pregnant rats as well as on the physiological course of the pregnancy. Study Design: Animal experiment. Methods: This study was approved by the Selçuk University Ethical Committee for Experimental Animal Research. Pregnant Winster Albino rats (n=26) were divided into three groups and administered with various intravenous injections on the 7th day of pregnancy. The control group (Group K, n=6) received 1.5 mL serum physiologic, the sugammadex group (Group S, n=10) received 30 mg/kg sugammadex and the sugammadex + rocuronium group (Group SR, n=10) received 30 mg/kg sugammadex and 3.5 mg/kg rocuronium. Progesterone levels were measured and the offspring were monitored for morphologic status. Results: Mean progesterone levels were 94.16±15.54 ng/mL in Group K, 87.86±12.48 ng/mL in Group S, and 94.53±16.10 ng/mL in Group SR (p>0.05). No stillbirth or miscarriage was observed in the rats. The mean number of offspring was 6.8±1.47 in Group K, 6.5±1.35 in Group S, and 6.4±1.17 in Group SR. The offspring appeared macroscopically normal. Conclusion: Sugammadex does not appear to affect the progesterone levels in pregnant rats in the first trimester and the clinical course. Successful completion of pregnancy and the absence of stillbirth or miscarriage will guide future studies about the use of sugammadex, particularly in the first trimester of the pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a virus belonging to the Parvoviridae family, which has been newly discovered to be associated with respiratory tract infections in children. There are many reports worldwide on the endemicity of this virus. Since it is relatively new, it is not routinely detected in clinical laboratory investigations. Case Report: We demonstrated that HBoV infection caused the death of a 5-month-old girl with a history of high fever and wheezing. Human bocavirus (HBoV 1/2/3/4) was found in a nasopharyngeal swab, paraffin-embedded lung tissue and stool samples by multiplex PCR methods using postmortem microbiological analysis. Conclusion: This case suggests that lower respiratory tract infections due to HBoV may cause severe and life-threatening diseases. Postmortem microbiology is useful in both clinical and forensic autopsies, and allows a suspected infection to be confirmed. To our knowledge, this report is the first document of a HBoV postmortem case in Turkey.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic drug. Acute transient myopia is a rare response to systemic medication. Unspecified ocular side effects of aripiprazole have rarely been reported. To the best of our knowledge, only 3 cases of aripiprazole induced myopia and diplopia have been reported in the literature. The aim of this article is to present a case of aripiprazole-induced acute transient myopia. Case Report: A 30 year-old woman underwent treatment for 5 days with aripiprazole and presented with bilateral painless blurred vision. The patient’s uncorrected visual acuity was 2/10 in both eyes and her best corrected visual acuity was 10/10 in both eyes with a refractive error of -3.00 diopters using a standard Snellen chart. Adding 2 mgs of biperiden a day to her treatment regimen decreased her blurred vision symptoms. After discontinuation of aripiprazole treatment and cross-switching to Paliperidon palmitate (75 mg/month) her blurred vision completely resolved. The same side effect did not re-occur when checked on her 6-month follow up. Conclusion: Ophthalmologists as well as psychiatrists must be aware of this myopic shift and should also ask these patients about medicine usage, especially aripiprazole. Ophthalmologists should consult the prescribing psychiatrist and stop the drug immediately to reverse this temporary condition.",
