    "abstract": "Abstract The testis develops in the abdominal cavity and descends into the scrotum. Although numerous theories have been proposed, the mechanism of descent and the reason for its inhibition remain unknown. Furthermore, none of the explanations account for the other occurrences related to the descent, such as failed obliteration of the processus vaginalis, or the reasons for the decrease in fertility and increase in the risk of malignancy associated with an undescended testis. The gubernaculum is a primitive mesenchymal tissue that was first described in 1786. However, the role of the gubernaculum in the descent process remains obscure. The testis descends through the processus vaginalis. Although the processus vaginalis (PV) is usually defined as a simple peritoneal protrusion, it actively develops into the gubernaculum. The gubernaculum gives rise to the smooth muscles that surround the processus vaginalis. The striated cremaster muscle (CM) is also derived from the gubernaculum. Because the testis descends through the processus vaginalis, the muscles develop to propel the testis. After propelling the testis, the smooth muscle (SM) undergoes programmed cell death. The initiation of programmed cell death through the intrinsic pathway requires activation of phospholipase C. A transient shift in the autonomic balance via a decrease in the sympathetic tonus and an increase in the parasympathetic tonus is essential for initiating this programmed cell death. Programmed cell death in the SM is the physiological pathway for the obliteration of the processus vaginalis. Differences in the timing, intensity, or duration of this physiological pathway result in pathological conditions. A shift before testicular descent diminishes the SM content that is required to propel the testis, and thus inhibits descent. The early shift persists throughout childhood and results in the decrease in fertility and increase in the risk of malignancy because of the differences in signal transduction. Despite a successful descent, persistence of the shift alters the contractility of the CM by increasing the cytosolic calcium levels. Contracted CMs retracts or even ascends the testis. Inadequate intensity or duration of the shift of autonomic tonus causes failure of the programmed cell death. Persistence of the SM hinders the obliteration of PV and gives rise to hydroceles or inguinal hernias depending on the amount of residual smooth muscles. Similar findings from different countries support these explanations. Thus, our proposed mechanism satisfactorily explains the process of descent while considering all the factors related to the process of testicular descent.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The fetal monogenic causes of early pregnancy losses (EPLs) are mainly unknown, with only a few articles on the subject published. In our previous study of EPLs using whole-exome sequencing analysis, we confirmed a genetic diagnosis of CPLANE1-related Joubert syndrome (JS) in three EPLs from two couples and identified a relatively common CPLANE1 allele among our population (NM_001384732.1:c.1819delT;c.7817T>A, further after referred as “complex allele”). Pathogenic variants in the CPLANE1 (C5orf42) gene are reported to cause JS type 17, a primary ciliopathy with various system defects.Aims: To examine the hypothesis that the CPLANE1 “complex allele,” whether homozygous or compound heterozygous, is a common cause of EPLs in our population.Study Design: Cohort study/case-control study.Methods: In this study, we used polymerase chain reaction-based methods to screen for CPLANE1 “complex allele” presence among 246 euploid EPLs (< 12 gestational weeks) from families in North Macedonia. We also investigated the impact of this allele in 650 women with EPLs versus 646 women with no history of pregnancy loss and at least one livebirth, matched by ethnic origin.Results: We found a high incidence of JS in the total study group of EPLs (2.03%), with a considerably higher incidence among Albanian families (6.25%). Although not statistically significant, women with EPLs had a higher allele frequency of the CPLANE1 “complex allele” (AF = 1.38%) than the controls (AF = 0.85%; p = 0.2). Albanian women had significantly higher frequency of the “complex allele” than the Macedonians (AF = 1.65% and 0.39%, respectively; p = 0.003).Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported incidence of fetal monogenic disease that might cause EPLs. Targeted screening for the CPLANE1 “complex allele” would be warranted in Albanian ethnic couples because it would detect one JS in every 16 euploid EPLs. Our findings have a larger impact on the pathogenesis of pregnancy loss and contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenicity of the variants in the CPLANE1 gene.",

The cytokine signal transduction inhibitor 3 (SOCS3) exerts significant regulatory effects on cell signal transduction pathways, thereby affecting various pathological processes.Aims: To explore the role and mechanism of SOCS3 on HVFs in the context of POP.Study Design: In vitro cell lines and human-sample study.Methods: Anterior vaginal wall tissues were obtained from POP or non-POP patients for the analysis of SOCS3 expression. HVFs were isolated from the vaginal tissues of POP patients, and SOCS3 was either overexpressed or knocked down in HVFs via lentivirus infection. Subsequently, the biological function and mechanism of SOCS3 in HVFs were investigated.Results: SOCS3 was highly expressed in the vaginal tissues of POP patients compared to non-POP patients. Functionally, the overexpression of SOCS3 suppressed cell viability while promoting cell apoptosis in HVFs. The overexpression of SOCS3 also accelerated extracellular matrix degradation (decreasing collagen I, collagen III, and elastin, and increasing MMP2 and MMP9). In terms of mechanism, NR4A1 transcriptionally activated SOCS3 by binding to its promoter. Furthermore, rescue experiments revealed that SOCS3 knockdown hindered NR4A1 overexpression-induced cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation in HVFs.Conclusion: SOCS3 mediated the apoptotic and extracellular matrix degradation effects of NR4A1 on HVFs, underlining that the restraining of the SOCS3 expression may be a promising strategy for POP treatment.",

The four variables were used to construct a prognostic nomogram for HCC.
