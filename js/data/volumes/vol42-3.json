    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) remains a leading cause of disability worldwide, placing a significant burden on patients’ quality of life and healthcare systems. Pentraxin-3 (PTX-3), an inflammatory biomarker, may be associated with AIS prognosis; however, existing evidence is inconclusive. Aims: To examine whether serum PTX-3 levels at admission are linked to the likelihood of poor functional outcomes in AIS patients. Study Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases was conducted to identify studies evaluating PTX-3 levels in AIS patients. Eligible studies included those that measured PTX-3 within 48 h of admission and evaluated outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale, with scores > 2 defined as poor outcomes. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Ten cohort studies involving1202 AIS patients were included. Higher PTX-3 levels at admission were significantly associated with an increased risk of poor functional outcomes (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.72-2.47; p < 0.001), with no significant heterogeneity (I² = 0%). Meta-regression showed that using higher PTX-3 cutoff values reported stronger associations (p < 0.05). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistent associations across study designs, patient characteristics, and timing of outcome assessment. The association was more pronounced in studies using a PTX-3 cutoff ≥ 3.3 ng/mL compared to those with a cutoff < 3.3 ng/mL. Conclusion: Elevated serum PTX-3 levels at admission may serve as a prognostic biomarker for poor functional outcomes in AIS. Differences in PTX-3 cutoff values and potential residual confounding should also be considered. Further multicenter studies involving diverse populations are necessary to confirm these results and establish PTX-3 as a reliable prognostic indicator in clinical practice.",

Aims: To investigate the etiology of hematospermia in Türkiye so as to contribute to the current management strategies for hematospermia. Methods: An online study protocol was published through the Turkish Urology Association communication network, and the centers that met the criteria were included in the study. All patients who presented with hematospermia complaints in the past 1 year were subjected to detailed anamnesis, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests. Based on the results, the patients were assigned to Group 1 (patients aged < 40 years with only one episode of hematospermia in the past 6 months) or Group 2 (patients with concomitant symptoms or ≥ 40 years or ≥ 2 times in the past 6 months). Radiological imaging was performed for the patients in Group 2. Results: A total of 199 patients (Group 1: 44, Group 2: 155; mean age: 43.07 ± 14.73 years; age range: 16-73 years) from across 42 cities and 22 different centers were enrolled in this study. In the etiological classification, inflammation was identified as the most common cause (n = 76, 38.1%). Idiopathic hematospermia was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (70.4% vs. 112.2%, respectively), and hematospermia was associated with malignancy in 9 (5.8%) Group 2 patients. Positivity was detected in urine or semen cultures in 20 (12.9%) patients, and hematospermia occurred after COVID-19 infection in 2 patients. A significant correlation was noted between patients showing no-concomitant symptoms and those showing idiopathic hematospermia, inflammation, malignancy, varicocele, and multiple etiological factors (p = 0.004, p = 0.028, p = 0.002, p = 0.001, p = 0.026, p = 0.016). The most common radiological findings were an increase in the prostate volume (n = 48, 30.9%) and changes in the signal intensities of the seminal vesicles (n = 29, 18.7%). Despite the use of different approaches to manage idiopathic hematospermia, the patients’ survey results were generally similar. Conclusion: Hematospermia in all age groups occurs generally due to self-limiting benign causes. Diagnostic imaging should therefore evaluate the elucidate etiology in patients with identified risk factors so as to avoid unnecessary treatments in idiopathic patients.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Background: Hematospermia is defined as the presence of blood in the semen. The data regarding its etiology and management is variable across the literature. Aims: To investigate the etiology of hematospermia in Türkiye so as to contribute to the current management strategies for hematospermia. Methods: An online study protocol was published through the Turkish Urology Association communication network, and the centers that met the criteria were included in the study. All patients who presented with hematospermia complaints in the past 1 year were subjected to detailed anamnesis, physical examination, and routine laboratory tests. Based on the results, the patients were assigned to Group 1 (patients aged < 40 years with only one episode of hematospermia in the past 6 months) or Group 2 (patients with concomitant symptoms or ≥ 40 years or ≥ 2 times in the past 6 months). Radiological imaging was performed for the patients in Group 2.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Targeted therapies directed at tumor immune checkpoint, like programmed death-ligand (PD-L)1/programmed death (PD)-1, have shown remarkable progress. Nevertheless, treatment efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is notably compromised due to the intricate immune microenvironment. Exploring alternative checkpoints beyond PD-L1/PD-1, including those not located on the cell surface, may improve our understanding of their roles in areas like diagnostic potential and immune tolerance in HCC. Aims: To explore the roles of serum exosomal CD155 (exo-CD155) in HCC. Study Design: Experimental study. Methods: We separated and analyzed serum exosomes from HCC patients. We quantified the concentrations of serum soluble CD155 (sCD155) and serum exo-CD155, and examined their association with disease progression, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) presence, and the concentrations of α-fetoprotein fraction L3 (AFP-L3) or alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Additionally, we assessed the diagnostic effect through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the immune suppressive effect on natural killer (NK) cells of exo-CD155. Results: This study reveal elevated exo-CD155 levels in all HCC patients, with a significant increase in early-stage patients, exhibiting normal AFP/AFP-L3 or HBsAg-positive status. Exo-CD155 is linked to the progression of HCC and shows significant diagnostic effectiveness for the disease. Furthermore, the incubation of NK-92MI with exosomes derived from HCC patients leads to a substantial reduction in immune function, which can be partially counteracted with an antibody that blocks T cell immune receptor immunoglobulin and ITIM domains, (TIGIT)-blocking antibody.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection occurs worldwide seasonally, especially in school-age children. Due to limited surveillance, clinicians report an increase of cases to identify outbreaks, while labs determine seropositivity rates. In 2024, B19V outbreak occurred in Türkiye and many other countries. Aims: To estimate incidences of B19V infection in Türkiye from 2020 to 2024 using National Infectious Disease Surveillance and Early Warning System (IZCI) and to determine case fatality rate (CFR) during the 2024 outbreak period. Study Design: Retrospective descriptive study. Methods: The number of cases was obtained from the syndromic surveillance of rash diseases in national database. All notifications with International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision diagnosis code “erythema infectiosum” within the syndromic surveillance were included in the study. All age groups were included in the study and no specific group was excluded. Annual estimated incidences were calculated for past 5 years. The distribution of cumulative incidence for the outbreak by age group and geographical regions was analysed. CFR was calculated for the outbreak period by using the proportion of people who have been diagnosed with B19V. Disease indicators were calculated as crude rates. Results: The estimated incidence in 2024 was 15.24 per 100,000. The peak of the outbreak was in May. The regions with the highest cumulative incidences during the outbreak period were the Black Sea, Marmara, and Central Anatolia. The highest cumulative incidence was 102.64 per 100,000 in 5-9 age group. The CFR was calculated as 0.0184% in the outbreak with 2 deaths out of 10,898 cases. Conclusion: Türkiye has experienced the largest B19V outbreak between February and June 2024. This study showed the unusual scale of B19V post-pandemic, suggesting that such outbreaks can be expected after pandemics. The establishment of syndromic surveillance has proved critical for early outbreak detection and response.",
