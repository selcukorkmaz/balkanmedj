    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the hemostatic agent (FastAct) exerts favourable effect on wound healing and tissue repair alone and along with prilocaine hydrochloride in vivo. Wound healing process is a complex procedure that starts with bleeding and hemostasis. Comprising of bovine factor proteins II, VII, IX and X, FastAct is used as a catalyst in the clot formation process to activate factors II, V, VIII and XIII. Materials and Methods: The study was performed on 21 Wistar male rats. Cutaneous incisions at the length of 4 cm. were made on the dorsal side of all animals. In seven, FastAct was applied alone between the wound edges and, in the other seven, FastAct was applied along with prilocaine. The wounds were sutured by resorbable suture material. Results: The specimens were obtained on the seventh day. Wound breaking strength test was performed before histological examination. In the FastAct group the epithelialization and the closure of the wound edge were better than the other groups. The results of the breaking strength test showed that the results were best in FastAct group. Conclusion: It's concluded that FastAct accomplished hemostasis, facilitated wound healing in accordance with natural processes.",

Although mitral and tricuspid annular systolic velocities with TDI (Sm, St) were similar between two groups, obtained diastolic functions showed a decrease in SSc patients. Tei index was statistically higher in SSc group (left ventricle MPI (LV-MPI): p<0.03 and right ventricle MPI (RV-MPI): p<0.007). Conclusion: Diastolic dysfunction of both ventricles with different echocardiographic methods was observed in diffuse SSc patients even without cardiac symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the possible anatomical risk factors of coronary heart disease (CHD) such as vascular geometry of the left coronary artery and its branches using coronary angiography. Patients and Methods: The trunk length (T) of the left coronary artery, the curve angle of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the bifurcation angle between the LAD and the circumflex artery (Cx) were measured in 77 patients (age range 20-83, mean 58.9±11.68). Results: The atherosclerotic plaque existence was investigated in LAD and Cx. The mean values of the T length, LAD curve angle and the LAD-Cx bifurcation angle were respectively 12.86 mm, 140.99° and 94.07°. In patients who have atherosclerotic plaques in LAD, the mean value of the T lengths was found 2.5 mm shorter than those of the patients whose LADs are intact (p=0.020). On the other hand a significant negative correlation between the LAD curve angle and the bifurcation angle was found (p<0.001).

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) which is characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia and a wide range of circulating auto antibodies is a necroinflammatory liver disease of unknown aetiology. Immunogenetic studies have shown the association of autoimmunity with HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) alleles. Furthermore, they have shown a decrease in the expression of HLA antigens on lymphocyte surface and a dysregulation of gene expression arranged by HLA. A significant association is found between AIH and HLA-DRB1*03, *04 and *13 alleles in various studies. We performed HLA-DRB1 genotyping in Turkish patients with AIH. Patients and Methods: The study group consisted of 113 patients (55 females, 58 males; mean age 44.8±21.21; range 10-82) with AIH and 300 healthy individuals (198 females, 102 males; mean age 32.4±10.48; range 17-50). After DNA isolation by standard methods, HLA-DRB1 typing was performed by using polymerase chain reaction amplification with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP). Results: HLA-DRB1*03 allele had a significantly increased frequency in the patient group. On the other hand, DRB1*13 allele had a significantly decreased frequency compared with the healthy controls.

Computed tomography measurements obtained from classic coronal and nasal base view (NBV) sections to determine the nasal valve angle were compared with the measurements obtained from nasal endoscopic examination images.

No statistically significant difference was observed between the endoscopic and NBV images measurements. Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that tomographic images obtained through NBV technique provide accurate measurements of nasal valve angle.

Accuracy of the mean frequency in differentiation of groups was statistically significant (p=0.024). 8 Hz was found to be convenient for differentiation of AD from NAD patients and 10 Hz for the differentiation of NAD patients and healthy subjects.

In this case report, we present a 3.5-year-old boy who was admitted with fever, dyspnea, wheezing, abdominal pain, weight loss and was diagnosed as pleuropulmonary blastoma. As pleuropulmonary blastoma is rarely seen in childhood, relevant literature on pleuropulmonary blastoma is reviewed.",

Materials and Methods: Six archery athletes and 10 sedentary males volunteered to participate in the study. Venous blood samples were taken after 10 minutes sitting and after 10 minutes in supine position. Plasma ANP levels were measured by the ELISA method. Cardiac parameters were assessed by echocardiography. Results: Plasma ANP levels in sitting position were higher in archery athletes (72.12±14.01 pg/ ml) than sedentaries (36.22±14.51 pg/ml; p<0.01). Similarly, plasma ANP levels in supine position (124.41±14.66 pg/ml) were significantly higher in the athletes than sedentaries (36.95±9.83 pg/ml). Plasma ANP levels were higher in supine position than those in sitting position in archery athletes (p<0.01). No significant increase in plasma ANP levels were found in supine position than sitting position in sedentary group. Echocardiographic parameters were similar in athletes and sedentary subjects. Conclusion: It is concluded that regular archery exercises without prominent functional and morphological alterations in the heart may cause differences in plasma ANP levels.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: This study was planned to evaluate whether possible changes in the hematological parameters and the biochemical markers can be used to detect obstruction-induced (strangulated) intestinal ischemia. Materials and Methods: Forty rats divided into five groups underwent the following procedures: Group 1 rats were treated with only laparotomy (sham-operated controls). To the strangulated hernia groups surgical induction of strangulated intestinal obstruction was performed. Tissue and blood samples were taken at 30 minutes (group 2), 2nd hour (group 3), 4th hour (group 4) and 6th hour (group 5) respectively, and then LDH, CPK, ALP, AST, ALT, D-dimer levels and blood cells counts were measured and histopathological examination was done. Results: Focal mucosal necrosis accompanied was confirmed by histological findings in the strangulated intestinal ischemia group after second hour. Serum D-dimer, ALT, ALP, CPK levels and neutrophil count became elevated at second hour, which was statistically significant. Conclusion: In patients with hernia, after reduction of the intestinal hernia, raised levels of serum D-dimer, ALT, ALP, CPK levels and neutrophil count may indicate the presence of a bowel ischemia.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Meningiomas are generally benign central nervous system neoplasms, which frequently express progesterone receptor (PR) and rarely express the estrogen receptor (ER). The significance of Her-2/neu expression in meningiomas is unclear. We evaluated the correlation with Her-2/neu, PR, ER expressions and clinicopathologic parameters in World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I meningiomas. Patients and Methods: In total, 53 cases of meningiomas were included in this study. Formaline-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were immunostained for Her-2/neu, PR and ER. Results: Whereas 27 (50.9%) of meningiomas were positive for PR, no reaction was determined for ER. Her-2/neu overexpression was observed in 12 (22.6%) cases. There was positive correlation between Her-2/ neu and PR expressions (p=0.015). Her-2/neu expression was frequently seen in meningothelial type (p=0.03). There were no correlations with Her-2/neu, ER, PR and other clinicopathologic parameters. Conclusion: The results of our study show that despite there being PR expression at a high rate in grade I meningiomas, ER expression is a rare finding. Moreover, Her-2/neu expression has been detected more often in the PR positive and meningothelial type.",
