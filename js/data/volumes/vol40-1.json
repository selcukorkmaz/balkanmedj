The techniques that allow machines to learn and get better at tasks such as recognition and prediction, which form the basis of clinical practice, are referred to as machine learning, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The number of artificial intelligence- and machine learnings-related publications in clinical journals has grown exponentially, driven by recent developments in computation and the accessibility of simple tools. However, clinicians are often not included in data science teams, which may limit the clinical relevance, explanability, workflow compatibility, and quality improvement of artificial intelligence solutions. Thus, this results in the language barrier between clinicians and artificial intelligence developers. Healthcare practitioners sometimes lack a basic understanding of artificial intelligence research because the approach is difficult for non-specialists to understand. Furthermore, many editors and reviewers of medical publications might not be familiar with the fundamental ideas behind these technologies, which may prevent journals from publishing high-quality artificial intelligence studies or, worse still, could allow for the publication of low-quality works. In this review, we aim to improve readers’ artificial intelligence literacy and critical thinking. As a result, we concentrated on what we consider the 10 most important qualities of artificial intelligence research: valid scientific purpose, high-quality data set, robust reference standard, robust input, no information leakage, optimal bias-variance tradeoff, proper model evaluation, proven clinical utility, transparent reporting, and open science. Before designing a study, one should have defined a sound scientific purpose. Then, it should be backed by a high-quality data set, robust input, and a solid reference standard. The artificial intelligence development pipeline should prevent information leakage. For the models, optimal bias-variance tradeoff should be achieved, and generalizability assessment must be adequately performed. The clinical value of the final models must also be established. After the study, thought should be given to transparency in publishing the process and results as well as open science for sharing data, code, and models.

Individuals who had a history of COVID-19 more than 3 weeks after vaccine doses, systemic disease, and diagnosis and treatment history of breast cancer were excluded. The axillary lymph nodes of the vaccinated and contralateral arms were evaluated in 101 volunteer healthcare professionals using axillary ultrasonography.Results: A significant difference was found in the cortical thicknesses of the lymph nodes between the vaccinated and contralateral axilla after both the first (*p < 0.01) and second (*p < 0.01) doses. Accordingly, the rates of subclinical lymphatic hyperplasia on the vaccinated side were 25.7% (n = 26/101) after the first and 31.1% (n = 28/90) after the second dose. Lymph nodes with pathological appearance based on a reduced echogenic hilum with marked cortical thickening were found only in 2.2%. Among the 39 cases in which antibodies (immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M) were measured, the antibody level was classified as <10 and ≥10. No statistically significant difference was found in the cortical thickness of the axillary lymph nodes between patients with high antibody levels (≥10) and those with low antibody levels (<10) (p > 0.05).Conclusion: In this study, clinical signs of axillary lymph node hyperplasia were not detected after vaccination with CoronaVac. Mild and diffuse thickening of the CoronaVac vaccine-induced lymph nodes was more common than pathological and palpable lymph nodes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: As one of the adverse events after hip fracture surgery, hypoalbuminemia is usually treated using human serum albumin infusion. However, the application of human serum albumin may cause complications such as postsurgical infection and increased mortality.Aims: To examine the preoperative risk factors of human serum albumin infusion after hip fracture surgery, establish a nomogram prediction model, and verify its accuracy.Study Design: A retrospective cross-sectional study.Methods: Eligible patients who underwent hip fracture surgery were divided into the infusion and non-infusion groups according to whether human serum albumin was infused or not. All patients were divided randomly into a training set and a testing set in line with the ratio of 7:3. In the training set, independent risk factors of postoperative human serum albumin infusion were determined by univariate logistic regression analysis, LASSO regression, and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Then, a nomogram model was established. Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration curve were plotted, and decision curve analysis was performed for the training and testing sets to assess the predictability, discriminative ability, and clinical usefulness of the model.Results: This study included a total of 1,339 eligible patients, 141 of whom were injected with human serum albumin postoperatively. Altogether, the training set incorporated 939 patients, and the testing set included 400 patients. Multivariate logistic analysis indicated five independent risk factors, including chronic lung disease (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, 2.618, 1.413-4.849, p = 0.002), (albumin; odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, 0.842, 0.787-0.900, p < 0.001), prothrombin time (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, 1.252, 1.071-1.463, p = 0.005), red blood cells (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, 0.370, 0.228-0.602, p < 0.001), and type of anesthesia (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval, 0.553, 0.327-0.937, p = 0.028).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Eltrombopag has an off-label indication for haematopoietic cell transplantation in patients experiencing delayed thrombocyte recovery and/or thrombocytopaenia.Aims: To present our centre’s experience of using this agent not only for post- haematopoietic cell transplantation thrombocytopaenia but also for poor graft functioning in the post-haematopoietic cell transplantation setting.Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.Methods: Thirty-nine patients who had persistent cytopaenia following haematopoietic cell transplantation and treated with eltrombopag at our centre between October 2011 and December 2021 were retrospectively identified. During this period, 9 (23.1%) and 30 (76.9%) patients who underwent allogeneic transplantations, respectively, received eltrombopag.Results: The female-to-male ratio was 12:27, and the median transplant age was 49 (18-70) years. Eight (20.5%) patients had isolated thrombocytopaenia, 19 (49.4%) had bi-lineage cytopaenia and 12 (30.1%) had pancytopaenia. Patients received a median of 50 mg/day (25-150 mg/day) of eltrombopagfor a median duration of 82 (24-386) days. Nine (23.1%) patients had autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation, and 30 (76.9%) had allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (14 unrelated, 9 sibling and 7 haploidentical). The median donor age was 32 (20-67) years. The median follow-up was 16.4 (1.8-84.3) months. The median pre-treatment platelet count was 11x109/l (1-23), which increased to 41x109/l (6-150). The median platelet count increment was 29.5x109/l (p = 0.001). The pre-treatment median neutrophil count was 1.19x109/l (0.39-5.1), which increased to 2.35 x109/l (0.1-5.33) (p = 0.05), and the pre-treatment median haemoglobin was 8.3 (6.2-14) g/dl, which increased to 10 (6.2-14) g/dl (p = 0.001) with eltrombopag. No eltrombopag-related hepatotoxicity occurred; however, 1 (2.6%) patient failed to continue treatment because of two consecutive episodes of deep venous thrombosis. Six (15.4%) patients were unresponsive to eltrombopag and dependent on blood product transfusions. After a median time of 82 days, 61.5% of the patients discontinued eltrombopag successfully.Conclusion: The results confirmed that eltrombopag could provide a rapid, sustained response in patients with poor graft functioning after haematopoietic cell transplantation. This finding is essential given the high rate of non-relapse mortality caused by poor graft functioning after haematopoietic cell transplantation.",

In human nasal mucosa epithelial cells, interleukin-13 enhanced SOX11 expression in a time-dependent manner, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) was involved in the interleukin-13-mediated expression of SOX11 by regulating transcription.
