Three groups comprising 10 rats each were studied: Group 1: control group; Group 2: DMH group; and Group 3: ondansetron group.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins have been implicated in contributing to all stages of tumorigenesis in many cancers, from initiating events to metastatic progression. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association of IRS-2 gene polymorphism with ovarian cancer. Material and Methods: The study group consisted of 185 women: 45 women with ovarian cancer and 140 control subjects. All the patients with ovarian cancer were primarily treated by surgical intervention. Genetic polymorphism of IRS-2 G1057D was detected by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- based restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP). Results: For IRS-2 G1057D polymorphism, the frequencies of GG, GD and DD genotypes were 60%, 33.3%, and 6.7%, respectively in the ovarian cancer cases and 53.6%, 38.6% and 7.9 % in controls.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) on in vitro embryonic development in rats. Material and Methods: The pregnant Wistar albino rats were killed by ether overdose at 9.5 days of gestation and the embryos (average of 10 embryos from each pregnant rat) were removed from the mother. In order to assess the effect of the FGF-9 on total embryonic growth, the embryos were divided into 4 groups. The control group (Group I) embryos were cultured in whole rat serum. Experimental groups (Group II-IV) were cultured in the presence of 1, 2 and 4 μg anti-FGF-9/per ml in whole rat serum. Results: Total morphologic score in the control and Groups II-IV were 59.6±0.51, 43.7±1.94, 42.4±13.52 and 29.2±10.97 respectively. There was a significant regression in the research group in the total morphologic score, yolk sac diameter, crown-rump lengths and somite number when compared to the control group. Conclusions: In the embryonic period, lack of FGF-9, which is produced by the embryo, could cause embryonic malformations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The impact of standardized patient feedback on the motivational levels of learners for learning communication skills was examined in the study. Material and Methods: Control group post-test design was used and 284 of Year-I students took part in the study (87%). Both groups were randomly organized. The students had two standardized patient encounters in addition to training and debriefing sessions. The study group students received face-to-face feedback after the first encounters; but not the control group. We used the motivation dimension of Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire and t-test to evaluate the differences between the average scores of motivational levels of both groups for all sub-dimensions. Results: After the first encounters, there is a significant difference between study and control groups in the sub-dimension of test anxiety (p=0.028). After the second encounters, the students of the study group who received feedback after the first encounters, got lower scores in the sub-dimension of test anxiety (p=0.016), and got higher scores in the subdimension of self-efficacy (p=0.027). Conclusion: We found out that the students who received feedback had lower levels of test anxiety, and higher levels of self-efficacy. Those results showed that standardized patient feedback eafected student motivational levels in two sub-dimensions.",

Also the most frequent diagnoses changed in these departments. The most frequent diagnoses before and after elimination were as follows; hypertension in comparison to anxiety disorders after elimination in cardiology, chronic obstructive lung disease compared to myalgia in respiratory medicine, fracture follow up compared to joint pain in orthopaedics, epilepsy compared to dizziness in neurology and infertility compared to vaginitis in gynecology. SII has paid 10.67 fold higher dues after elimination for these 7 departments and diagnoses.

Material and Methods: We used a questionnaire including the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form. Frequency tables, cross tabulations, Pearson Chi-square, Exact Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn's Multiple Comparison and Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age of 560 participants was 33.86±7.33 years, of whom 47% (n=263) were female and 53% (n=297) male. Of the participants, the mean levels were 63.06±10.96 for general, 44.79±7.49 for intrinsic, and 18.27±4.64 for extrinsic job satisfaction. 85.4% of the academic staff (n=478) had a moderate level of satisfaction, whereas 14.6% (n=82) had a higher level. There was a significant relationship between income and job satisfaction levels. With the CHAID analysis, it was determined that job satisfaction had a relationship with age, educational status, total years of service and years of service in the current department. Conclusion: Job satisfaction can reflect the general emotional status of employees. It has a greater importance for the jobs that can affect the extraoccupational lives directly and require constant devotion. Employers should take some measures to increase job satisfaction in order to improve efficiency.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Objective: In this paper, we aimed to investigate the job satisfaction levels of all the academic staff in Trakya University, along with their socioeconomic features. Material and Methods: We used a questionnaire including the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form. Frequency tables, cross tabulations, Pearson Chi-square, Exact Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, Dunn's Multiple Comparison and Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age of 560 participants was 33.86±7.33 years, of whom 47% (n=263) were female and 53% (n=297) male. Of the participants, the mean levels were 63.06±10.96 for general, 44.79±7.49 for intrinsic, and 18.27±4.64 for extrinsic job satisfaction. 85.4% of the academic staff (n=478) had a moderate level of satisfaction, whereas 14.6% (n=82) had a higher level. There was a significant relationship between income and job satisfaction levels. With the CHAID analysis, it was determined that job satisfaction had a relationship with age, educational status, total years of service and years of service in the current department. Conclusion: Job satisfaction can reflect the general emotional status of employees. It has a greater importance for the jobs that can affect the extraoccupational lives directly and require constant devotion.

Material and Methods: The characteristic and pathologic parameters of 280 patients operated on for nonmetastatic colorectal cancer at our service were recorded retrospectively. Patients were stratified into 4 groups according to the LNR quartiles of 1/12, ¼, ½ and 1. Distribution of demographic data and probability tables were made by ANOVA and χ2 tests. The cumulative survival ratios for LNR, N stage and TNM stage were calculated by the Kaplan Meier method and survival difference between groups were calculated by the log rank test. Results: There was a statistically significant correlation ratio between metastatic lymph node count and LNR. In 173 of all patients (61.8%) fewer than 12 lymph nodes were harvested. One hundred sixtysix (59.3%) patients were evaluated as N0, 79 (28.2%) were N1 and 35 (12.5%) were N2.

Isolated trans-hiatal herniation of the transverse colon is very rare and only five cases have been reported.

Because of the severe complications of hiatal hernia, including bleeding, strangulation, and perforation, early diagnosis and treatment are important. A 75-year-old man who had prostate carcinoma was evaluated with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT).

    "abstract": "Abstract Osteomyelitis of the calvarial bones can cause serious complications such as brain abscess, due to the close proximity to adjacent brain structures. Development of the purulent secretion in surgery and traumatic scalp injuries must be considered as a possibility of osteomyelitis possibility. Generally gram positive, rarely gram negative bacteria and mix agents, can be isolated in infection. Especially chronic pyogenic osteomyelitis agents can be isolated from chronic infections such as tuberculosis. In cranial osteomyelitis diagnosis, radiological diagnosis has a very important place together with the clinical diagnosis. However, infection can usually show late findings radiologically. In treatment, antibiotic treatment is absolutely essential as well as removal of the infected part of the bone. Due to antibiotic treatment lasting between 6-12 weeks, organizing the antibiotic protocols according to the results of culture-antibiograms, which were provided from purulent secretions, has the most important role in the success of surgical treatment. In Proteus sp. infections, for choice of suitable treatment, determination of the type of bacteria is important. For exact diagnosis, histopathological examination of the bone tissue must be carried out. In this report, a case with cranial osteomyelitis caused by Proteus vulgaris which is a gram negative bacteria causing anaerobic infections and classified in the Enterobacteriaceae family is presented.
