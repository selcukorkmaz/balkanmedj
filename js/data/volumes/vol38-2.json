    "abstract": "Angioedema without wheals (urticaria) represents a heterogeneous group of clinically indistinguishable diseases of hereditary or acquired etiology. Hereditary angioedema is a rare inherited condition leading to recurrent, sometimes life-threatening angioedema attacks in subcutaneous tissues and gastrointestinal and oropharyngeal mucosa dating back to childhood or adolescence. Most of these patients have mutations in the SERPING1 gene, causing either low C1 inhibitor production (hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency type I) or the production of dysfunctional C1 inhibitor (hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency type II). Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor has been defined later. Although C1 inhibitor concentration and function are in the normal range, it leads to typical hereditary angioedema symptoms owing to mutations in FXII, PLG, ANGPT1, KNG1, and MYOF genes. Patients who exhibit none of these genetic mutations despite having a similar clinical presentation are classified as having unknown hereditary angioedema. Fewer than 1 in 10 patients with C1 inhibitor deficiency have acquired angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency. The clinical presentation is very similar to that of hereditary angioedema, making it difficult to distinguish these 2 conditions clinically. Unlike hereditary angioedema, there are no genetic mutations, and family history and symptoms tend to appear later in life. Acquired angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency is commonly associated with lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases. Angioedema attacks might start 1 year before the underlying disease in acquired angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency. Approximately half of the patients admitted to the hospital for acute angioedema are patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy. Angioedema typically occurs on the lips, tongue, mouth, pharynx, and subglottic regions. Patients may require hospitalization and intensive care monitoring owing to airway involvement. Idiopathic histaminergic acquired angioedema may be diagnosed only when any possible causes of histaminergic angioedema are excluded (foods, drugs, animal dander, aeroallergens, insect stings, latex, and others), and the symptoms respond well to antihistamine treatment. Idiopathic nonhistaminergic acquired angioedema should be considered when all other types of recurrent angioedema have been ruled out and patients do not respond to high-dose antihistamines. The lack of a standard biochemical laboratory test for patients with idiopathic histaminergic acquired angioedema, idiopathic nonhistaminergic acquired angioedema, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced acquired angioedema, and hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor makes the diagnosis more challenging. Future efforts should focus on increasing awareness of all the rare types of angioedema among physicians and developing more straightforward and more accessible diagnostic methods.",

    "abstract": "Background: Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas are very rare lung neoplasms, and no consensus exists regarding their optimal treatment. The prognosis of sarcomatoid carcinomas has been reported to be unfavorable compared with non-small-cell lung cancers; however, prognostic factors in patients undergoing surgery for sarcomatoid carcinomas remain unclear.Aims: To analyze clinicopathologic prognostic factors and survival outcomes in patients who underwent surgery for pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma.Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.Methods: We designed a retrospective cross-sectional study in patients who underwent surgery for pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas and statistically analyzed the prognostic factors regarding clinicopathologic features with respect to survival outcomes.Results: We had a total of 44 patients with sarcomatoid carcinoma who had pulmonary resection. Sex distribution was 34 (77%) males and 10 (22.7%) females, which was determined by declaration. The mean age of patients was 57.3 ± 16 years with a median of 60 years. The 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 59% and 58%, respectively. The 5-year survival rates were significantly different for tumors > 5 cm (P = 0.044), tumorstatus (T) (P=0.016), lymph node status (N) (P=0.005), and pathologic tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (P = 0.0001 ). However, histologic subtype (P = 0.628) and adjuvant treatment (P = 0.804) did not have any significant effect on survival. Similarly, the significant prognostic factors in univariate analysis were tumor size (P = 0.085), T status (P = 0.005), N status (P = 0.028), and pathologic TNM stage (P = 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed only T status (P = 0.058), N status (P = 0.018), and pathologic TNM stage (P = 0.019) as independent prognostic factors, with statistical power of 87%, 43.1% and 21.2%.Conclusion: Surgery appears to be an optimal treatment with favorable outcomes for patients with pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma.

    "abstract": "Background: Approximately half of the children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder continue to meet diagnostic criteria in adulthood. The prevalence of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is reported between 2.5% and 4.4% and is associated with significant impairment in quality of life and increased psychiatric comorbidity. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults remains mostly undiagnosed and/or untreated despite the availability of effective treatments. The majority of people who do not receive necessary treatment are in the nonclinical or nonpsychiatric clinical population. Screening is an important step for diagnosing adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Yet, there are no valid and reliable screening questionnaires calibrated for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-5 in Turkish.Aims: We aimed to test the reliability and the validity of the Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5 screening questionnaire designed according to DSM-5 in the Turkish population.Study Design: Methodological and cross-sectional study.Methods: The translation was carried out according to the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview translation guide using a linguistic adaptation approach. We used a convenience sampling method to recruit an individual with adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 68) and a control group (n = 68). The participants completed a sociodemographic form, 6-items Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5, and the previous version 18-items Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-v1.1 for the concurrent validity analysis. For the diagnostic validity, clinical diagnosis made by psychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-5 criteria was used. Internal consistency and item-total correlation coefficients, exploratory factor analyses, correlation with Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-v1.1, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were conducted.Results: The internal consistency measured by Cronbach alpha was 0.869. Item-total correlation coefficients were calculated to be between 0.602 and 0.717, and the correlations were statistically significant (P < 0.0001). The Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5 showed to have a unidimensional factor structure explaining 60.54% of the variance. The correlation between Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5 and Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-v1.1 total score was calculated as 0.992 (P < 0.0001), and that between Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5 and Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-v1.1 attention-deficit subdimension was 0.868 (P < 0.0001). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis of Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5, the area under the curve was found to be 0.916. The cut-off score was calculated as 9 of 10 with a sensitivity of 85.2% and specificity of 89.7%.Conclusion: Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5 is a valid and reliable self-report measure to assess and screen attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in the Turkish population.

    "abstract": "Background: Making the right decisions in the field of public health depends on the reliable recording of statistical data such as death and birth. There have been radical changes and innovations in the death registration since 2009 in Turkey to improve reporting.Aims: To examine the distribution and the trend of causes of death between the years 2009 and 2017 in Turkey.Study Design: Descriptive study.Methods: In this study, the causes of death were evaluated in three groups used in the Global Burden of Disease study. Group I included infectious, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions; group II included noncommunicable diseases; and group III included injuries. Age-standardized mortality rates were calculated per 100,000 according to age, sex, and cause of death. Joinpoint regression was used to evaluate the trend in mortality rates. In addition, the leading causes of death were also determined.Results: In total, age-standardized mortality rates increased significantly on average annually (1.5% per year). When the trends of causes of death were examined according to gender, there was a significant increase in deaths from group I in both genders and a significant increase in deaths from group III in males, whereas there was no statistically significant change in deaths from group II between 2009 and 2017.Conclusion: A significant quantitative improvement in death registration was seen in Turkey between the years 2009 and 2017. This is due to the increase in the number of reported deaths. The change in the distribution of causes of death is noteworthy. This research can provide the basis for further researches that will examine the change in causes of death.",

The medial olivocochlear pathway, a part of the auditory efferent system, plays a role in stimulus-related control of the cochlea. One clinical tool to evaluate the medial olivocochlear activity, which is thought to improve speech perception in noise, is the suppression of otoacoustic emissions.Aims: This study investigated the suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in children with phonological disorder in comparison with that in typically developing controls.Study Design: Case-control study.Methods: A total of 23 children with phonological disorder (aged 5-10 years) and 21 age- and sex-matched controls (P > 0.05) participated in the study. Participants had pure-tone thresholds ≤ 15 dB hearing loss and normal middle ear functions. Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions with and without contralateral acoustic stimulation were measured.Results: Although the mean transient evoked otoacoustic emissions suppressions were lower in the group with phonological disorder than in the controls, these differences were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). No left/right ear asymmetry of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions suppression was detected in either of the groups (P > 0.05).Conclusion: Children with phonological disorder did not show alterations in medial olivocochlear functioning in the medial olivocochlear activity as measured by the contralateral suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions.",
