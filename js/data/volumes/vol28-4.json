Material and Methods: A total of 18 male Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups: control, common bile duct ligation (BDL) and BDL+curcumin. Each group contained 6 animals. The rats in the curcumin treated group were given curcumin (100 mg/kg) once a day orally for 14 days, starting 3 days prior to BDL operation. Following 14 days of treatment, all the animals were decapitated and liver tissue samples were obtained for histopathological investigation. Results: The changes demonstrating the bile duct proliferation and fibrosis in expanded portal tracts, including the extension of proliferated bile ducts into lobules, mononuclear cells, and neutrophil infiltration into the widened portal areas, were observed in BDL group. Treatment of BDL with curcumin attenuated liver damage. Both the elevated alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and the activity of TUNEL in the BDL were observed to be reduced with the curcumin treatment. Conclusion: Our data indicate that curcumin reduced BDL-induced cholestatic liver injury, bile duct proliferation, fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: In our study, we aimed to compare epidural morphine and fentanyl analgesia and the side effects in post-thoracotomy pain management. Material and Methods: Forty patients, planned for elective thoracotomy were included. Bupivacain- morphine was administered through an epidural catheter to the patients in Group-M while bupivacain-fentanyl was given in Group-F. Pain assessment was carried out with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and VAS-I and VAS-II were assessed in 0, 4, 16 and 24th hour in the postoperative unit. Adverse effects were recorded after the 24th hour. Statistical analyses were performed by using Two-sample independent-t test, Mann Whitney-U test, Wilcoxon-signed ranks test and Pearson chi-squared tests. Results: Although, the VAS-I and VAS-II scores were lower in Group-M than Group-F, the difference was not significant statistically (p>0.05). When other hours were compared with initial states, beginning from the 4th hour, in both groups there was a statistically significant drop in VAS-I and VAS-II scores at all times (p<0.001). Comparing the complications between the groups, in Group-M nausea-vomiting (p<0.015) and bradycardia (p<0.012) were found significantly more frequently than in Group-F. Conclusion: We concluded that, in pain management after thoracic surgery, either morphine or fentanyl may be chosen in thoracal epidural analgesia but, especially in the early postoperative hours, close follow-up is necessary due to the risk of bradycardia development.",

GBS may cause perinatal infection and premature birth in pregnant women. The aim of this study was to serotype GBS strains isolated from clinical samples and evaluate their serotype distribution according to their susceptibilities to antibiotics and isolation sites. Material and Methods: One hundred thirty one S. agalactiae strains isolated from the clinical samples were included in the study. Of the strains, 99 were isolated from urine, 20 from soft tissue, 10 from blood and 2 from vaginal swab. Penicillin G and ceftriaxone susceptibilities of GBS were determined by the agar dilution method. Susceptibilities to erythromycin, clindamycin, vancomycin and tetracycline were determined by the Kirby-Bauer method according to CLSI criteria. Serotyping was performed using the latex aglutination method using specific antisera (Ia, Ib, II-VIII). Results: While in 131 GBS strains, serotypes VII and VIII were not detected, the most frequently isolated serotypes were types Ia (36%), III (30.5%) and II (13%) respectively. Serotype Ia was the most frequently seen serotype in all samples. All GBS isolates were susceptible to penicilin G, ceftriaxone and vancomycin. Among the strains, tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rates were determined as 90%, 14.5%, and 13% respectively.

The age, gender, causes of HI, basic neurologic examination findings, radiologic findings and discharge status are examined. Results: Most of the data were simplified as absent (0) and present (1), and mortality rates for each groups were accepted weighted values. All data were processed statistically and two models were created. Model 1 with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score predicted the mortality/vegetative event at a rate of 56.5%, and the conscious survival event at 98.7%. Model 2, without the GCS score, predicted the mortality/vegetative event at 55.1% rate and the conscious survival event at 99.2%. Conclusion: Both models could be used for informing the patient and relatives and helping them to understand the severity of HI in busy working conditions of emergency departments.",

Material and Methods: Standard immunohistochemistry was performed in 100 malignant, 27 borderline and 31 benign tumors and 42 non-tumoral ovarian epithelia. Results: TP53 overexpression was higher in malignant (61.0%) than in borderline tumors (40.7%); in malignant cases above 50 years-of-age, with high grade and in undifferentiated and serous subtypes. Carcinomas with solid architecture in serous, high mitosis in non-serous and high pleomorphism in both subtypes; lymph node involvement, and advanced stage also showed higher expressions of TP53 (p<0.05). The mean Ki-67 index was 41.3% in malignant and 17.2% in borderline tumors. Ki-67 index tended to increase with increasing grade, and decrease with lymph node involvement. The coexpression of proteins according to grade, lymph node involvement and stage in different subtypes, showed significant differences and correlations. Conclusion: Our findings support the role of TP53 overexpression in development of “borderline” and malignant epithelial ovarian tumors.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The investigation of factors affecting the dimension and configuration of the intranasal ostium in successful external dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). Material and Methods: Fifty-one patients were enrolled within this study. During operation, dimensions of bone window were measured. In the postoperative sixth month, changes in bone window size were evaluated using spiral paranasal tomography, and the intranasal ostium was examined with nasal endoscopy. Results: There were 19 patients who underwent DCR and 32 patients who underwent DCR+silicone tube intubations (SI). The mean bone window size was 214.37 mm2 during operation and 214.87 mm2 after six months. The mean intranasal ostium size was measured as 51.42 mm2 for patients who had undergone DCR and 28.66 mm2 for the DCR+SI cases. The endoscopic appearance of the ostium was observed as oval or round for the DCR cases and in slit form for the DCR+SI cases. A multiple logistic regression model showed that silicon tube intubation posed an 11 times greater risk for configuration distortion in the intranasal ostium (p=0.0079). Conclusion: Postoperative intranasal ostium size has a relation with the intraoperative bone window size. The difference of mean intranasal ostium sizes of DCR and DCR+SI cases was not statistically significant. However, because SI gives rise to ostium configuration by triggering fibrosis, it should not be carried out unless absolutely necessary.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: The Turkish anti-tobacco law was accepted and effectuated in 1996. All forms of cigarette advertising, the sale of tobacco products to persons under the age of 18 and smoking in public institutions were all restricted. In this paper, we aimed to evaluate the influence of the Turkish antitobacco law on children for the periods before the law, after three years and after 10 years. Material and Methods: A self-completed questionnaire was distributed among primary school children. This included questions about the children's smoking habits, their opinions of parents' and teachers' smoking habits, tobacco use in public places and the recognition rate of 16 food, drink, cigarette and toothpaste logos and brand names. The first, second and third applications of the questionnaire were performed with students who attended the same classes in the same primary schools, accounting for 772 children in June 1996, 1,157 children in February 1999 and 719 children in June 2006. Results: When these three periods were evaluated, it could be seen that the prevalence of having smoked significantly decreased (13.9%, 4%, 2.2%, p<0.001), as did the rate of purchasing cigarettes within the past week (36.6%, 29.1%, 15.8%, p<0.001). The disagreement with parents' and teachers' smoking habits and tobacco usage in public places increased significantly (p<0.001), while the recognition rates of some cigarette brand names and logos significantly decreased, specifically with regards to Marlboro, Camel and Samsun (p<0.001).

Material and Methods: All patients describing typical chest pain were enrolled in the study. Demographic features and final diagnosis were written and serum specimens were collected. All patients were telephoned after one month to determine if there were any adverse cardiac events. Results: There were 132 patients, (94 male, 38 female). The mean age was 60.92±10.78. 55 patients were diagnosed as AMI (37 STEMI and 18 NSTEMI) 60 patients as unstable angina pectoris, 15 patients as stable angina pectoris and 2 patients as non cardiac chest pain. 6 patients died in the hospital. 15 patients had adverse cardiac events (12 recurrent AMI, 2 sudden cardiac death, 1 stroke). The levels of D-dimer, CRP and IL-6 at the presentation were not predictive for adverse events. Conclusion: D-dimer, CRP and IL-6 levels were high both in ACS and stable angina.

Daytime sleepiness was evaluated by Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and measurement of erectile function was performed by International Index of Erectile Function. Results: The rate of erectile dysfunction in OSAS and control groups were 54.2% and 33.3% respectively (p=0.204).

In order to test this hypothesis, we assayed these antibodies in children and adolescents diagnosed with tic disorders and/or OCD. Material and Methods: Children and adolescents who were diagnosed with either tic disorders or OCD according to DSM-IV criteria (n=28), were compared with healthy controls (n=15) having similar age and gender characteristics. Regardless of a streptococcus infection history, serum samples of all patients and controls underwent antinuclear, cytoskeletal, and antineuronal antibody assay using indirect immunofluorescence. Results: The rates of antinuclear antibody positivity were 21% and 20% in the patient and control groups respectively (p>0.05). Antineuronal antibody was positive in 2 (7%) of 28 patients versus in 1 (6%) of 15 controls (p>0.05).

    "previewText": "Abstract Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology and it may rarely be associated with a second disorder. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy characterized with malabsorption caused by gluten intolerance, and several reports indicate an association between celiac disease and sarcoidosis. In addition, although celiac disease is associated with several extraintestinal pathologies, venous thrombosis has been rarely reported. Herein we present a rare case report of a patient with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, celiac disease and deep venous thrombosis because of the rare association of these disorders. The patient was admitted with abdominal pain, weight loss, chronic diarrhea and a 5-day history of swelling in her right leg. A diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis was achieved by doppler ultrasonographic examination. The diagnosis of celiac disease was made by biopsy of duodenal mucosa and supported with elevated serum level of anti-gliadin IgA and IgG, and a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was achieved by transbronchial needle aspiration from the subcarinal lymph node during flexible bronchoscopy.",

We report the case of a 60-year-old woman who was admitted with a 6-year history of slow enhancing intrapulmonary nodular lesion in her right upper lobe on chest computed tomography (CT). A right upper lobectomy was performed for complete excision of the tumour and the postoperative histopathological examination revealed SFT. No pathology was observed during the period of 34-month postoperative follow-up. Herein we present an extremely rare case of intrapulmonary SFT that was located in the deep pulmonary parenchyma.",

Intravenous Pyelography (IVP) showed duplication of the right ureter and triplication of the left ureter.
