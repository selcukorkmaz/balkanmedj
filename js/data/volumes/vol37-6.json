In opposition to the classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol and dipyrone exert weak anti-inflammatory activity, their antinociceptive effects appearing to be mostly due to mechanisms other than peripheral cyclooxygenase inhibition. In this review, we classify classical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol and dipyrone as \"non-opioid analgesics\" and discuss the mechanisms mediating participation of the endocannabinoid system in their antinociceptive effects.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Oral immunotherapy for cow’s milk allergy is an effective treatment option because of its ability to increase the threshold for clinical reactions.Aims: To present our experience of oral immunotherapy for cow’s milk allergy in the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic, and to evaluate the long-term efficacy of oral immunotherapy and risk factors for adverse reactions during oral immunotherapy.Study Design: Single-center retrospective cohort study.Methods: Forty-two patients with Immunoglobulin-E-mediated cow’s milk allergy who complied with the oral immunotherapy protocol were evaluated in this study. The treatment consisted of a rapid escalation phase with an oral food challenge step that included milk doses. During the build-up phase, increasing quantities of cow’s milk were administered until the patient was able to consume 200 mL of cow’s milk daily.Results: The mean age of starting the oral immunotherapy was 40.2±3.2 (range, 36-156) months, and 54.8% (n=23) of the patients were males. The mean duration of the build-up phase was 18.1±5.6 (range, 9-41) weeks, and the mean maintenance phase was 29.1±11.6 (range, 12-63) months. During the oral immunotherapy, 36 adverse reactions (78% mild and 22% moderate) occurred in 16 (38%) patients. There were no differences in the age of starting the oral immunotherapy (p=0.19), cow’s milk-specific Immunoglobulin-E levels (p=0.17), and cumulative provocative doses of oral food challenges (p=0.78) between the two groups of patients with and without adverse reactions. The wheal diameters to cow’s milk were higher in the group with adverse reactions (p=0.03). There was no difference in the oral immunotherapy onset age between patients with and without a history of anaphylaxis (p=0.38). The patients with a history of anaphylaxis had more adverse reactions (p=0.04) and a higher number of reactions during the oral immunotherapy (p=0.01), and a higher mean duration of the up-dosing phase (p=0.04) compared with patients without anaphylaxis.Conclusion: Oral immunotherapy is a treatment option in patients with cow’s milk allergy because of its high efficacy. Adverse reactions occur in about 40% of cases and are mostly mild. It should be administered with caution to patients with a history of anaphylaxis and a higher wheal diameter to cow’s milk in the skin prick test.",

However, little data are available on the prognosis of children with Kawasaki disease who developed coronary artery lesions before intravenous immunoglobulin treatment.Aims: To explore the outcomes of coronary artery lesions before intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in children with Kawasaki disease and analyze the factors that influence the duration of coronary artery lesions.Study Design: Retrospective cohort study.Methods: All patients with Kawasaki disease who developed coronary artery lesions before intravenous immunoglobulin treatment in our hospital from January 2009 to December 2014 were reviewed. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine the factors influencing the prognosis of coronary artery lesions.Results: Among 182 patients included, 28.6% were male, 83.50% were younger than 36 months, and 181 exhibited resolution of coronary artery lesions 2 years after disease onset. The median duration of coronary artery lesions was 31 days, and the proportion of coronary artery lesions was 52% at 1 month, 35% at 2 months, 33% at 3 months, 25% at 6 months, 14% at 1 year, and 0.5% at 2 years. The univariate analysis showed that overweight status, higher platelet count, lower albumin level, and starting treatment more than 10 days after disease onset were factors that possibly affect the duration of coronary artery lesions in children.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system and it has become the fastest growing cancer among women. The suspected risk factors include increased exposure to ionizing radiation during childhood, environmental pollutants, possible iodine deficiency, and excessive iodine exposure.Aims: To analyze the thyroid cancer incidence between 1980 and 2013 in Bulgaria and to determine the incidence rate before and after the introduction of universal salt iodization in 1994 in regions with different iodine deficiency levels.Study Design: Retrospective cohort.Methods: The study was a retrospective analysis of the total number of thyroid cancer cases with all histological types in Bulgaria (thyroid cancer, ICD10 code C73), diagnosed between 01/01/1980 and 31/12/2013, and retrieved from the anonymous cancer registry database of the Bulgarian National Cancer Registry. Age-standardized rates of thyroid cancer per 100,000 persons were calculated for each year of the periods mentioned below by sex and age, utilizing the WHO world reference populations with a special statistical module of the Bulgarian National Cancer Registry’s software CancerRegBG, 2011. Incidence rates were reported by age, sex, and period of diagnosis (1980-86, 1987-93, 1994-99, 2000-2006, 2007-2013). Trends among males and females were analyzed separately, as well as by age category: 0-19, 20-44, 45-64, and 65+. Annual percentage changes of age-standardized incidence rates were analyzed by Joinpoint regression to determine trends using the Joinpoint statistical software SEER* Stat Software, Version 4.1.1, 2014.Results: The age-standardized rates of thyroid cancer in Bulgaria has been increasing since 1990, being higher among women compared to men (4.68 vs 2.81). The highest age-standardized rates of thyroid cancer was observed in women in the 2007-2013 period. The only significant joinpoint was recorded in 1990 for females and in 1991 for males. The highest incidence rates was in the Smolyan district, a region with historically existing iodine deficiency and relatively high post-Chernobyl radiation exposure.Conclusion: Our results showed that, in different regions, the age-standardized thyroid cancer rates between endemic and non-endemic differ greatly depending on the radiation dose from the Chernobyl accident. The role of iodine intake in thyroid cancer remains uncertain, but iodine deficiency could be a contributing factor to the increased risk of thyroid cancer.",

These biomarkers should rapidly analyze, have high specificity for brain damage, and be available in the emergency settings for early diagnosis and exclusion of other conditions that mimic acute ischemic stroke. Soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis, a protein involved in the regulation of several biological functions, could be a potential acute ischemic stroke biomarker.Aims: To investigate the diagnostic value of soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke and examine the relationship between ischemic area volume determined at diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis.Study Design: A prospective, case-control study.Methods: This case-control prospective study included 36 patients with acute ischemic stroke and 36 healthy volunteers. Information on age, sex, presence of chronic disease, neurological examination findings, times of presentation to the emergency department after acute ischemic stroke, soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis levels, ischemic area volumes at diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and 6-month mortality rates after stroke were recorded. The results were analyzed on SPSS 22.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: A soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis cut-off value of 995.5 pg/mL exhibited a sensitivity of 80.5% and a positive predictive value of 82.5% with an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% confidence interval: 0.74-0.94; p<0.001). The mean soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis levels in the acute ischemic stroke group (1968.08±1441.99 μg/L) were significantly higher than those in the control group (704.81±291.72 μg/L) (p<0.001). No correlation was observed between soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis levels and ischemic area volume measured at diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (r=-0.008; p=0.07). The mean ischemic area volume was 505.68±381.10 and 60.96±80.89 mm3 in the nonsurviving and surviving patients, respectively (p=0.002).Conclusion: Soluble tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis can be used in the diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke. However, it is inconclusive in estimating ischemic area volume and early mortality following acute ischemic stroke. Ischemic area volume measured at diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is a marker of poor prognosis and can be used in predicting early mortality.",

However, the success of polymethylmethacrylate injection in the treatment of osteoporotic coccyx fractures and coccydynia is still unknown.Case Report: A 68-year-old man was admitted to our clinic with complaints of pain in the sacrococcygeal and perianal regions. In the imaging studies, a fracture line in the fifth sacral and first coccygeal segments was observed as evidenced by a bony edema.

Some of them have a history of 900 years (Konya Mâristan-ı Atik, 1113; and Mardin Eminüddin Bimaristanı, 1122). In addition, some are in the form of a medical madrasah and an application hospital (Kayseri, 1206; Sivas, 1217). In these institutions, great masters of Islamic medicine (Razi, Fârâbî, Bîrûnî, İbni Sina) and ancient authorities (Hippocrates, Dioscorides, Aretaeus, Galenos) were taught. These institutions had builders, rulers (sultan, melik) or mothers, wives, daughters, and sisters (the presence of female builders in these institutions attracted attention). During the Seljuk period, powerful viziers also built such institutions. These hospitals also provided free services which were considered as “charities” according to the Islamic religion. These institutions were financed by sources (shops, inns, Turkish baths, bridges, mills, vineyards, gardens, fields and annual taxes of many villages) that donated funds through the “foundation” method. Donations were made in the presence of the “kadi” (muslim judges) and many witnesses, with the written document “endowment.” These foundations were not touched by subsequent monarchs. Payment of fees, daily expenses of the physicians, assistant personel and repairing of buildings was done by the board of trustees. Twelve of these institutions are still in use for public interest (polyclinic, museum, health museum, library, university, and education center). When modern medical schools (1827) and hospitals (1842) began to be established as of the XIXth century, these historic buildings were allocated to mental patients, while some were devastated by neglect. However, in the Republic period, they have been restored and used for health and educational purposes. <",
