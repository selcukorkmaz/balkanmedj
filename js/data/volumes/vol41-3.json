    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has urgently necessitated effective therapeutic solutions, with a focus on rapidly identifying and classifying potential small-molecule drugs. Given traditional methods’ labor-intensive and time-consuming nature, deep learning has emerged as an essential tool for efficiently processing and extracting insights from complex biological data.Aims: To utilize deep learning techniques, particularly deep neural networks (DNN) enhanced with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), to enhance the classification of binding activities in anti-SARS-CoV-2 molecules across various bioassays.Methods: We used 11 bioassay datasets covering various SARS-CoV-2 interactions and inhibitory mechanisms. These assays ranged from spike-ACE2 protein-protein interaction to ACE2 enzymatic activity and 3CL enzymatic activity. To address the prevalent class imbalance in these datasets, the SMOTE technique was employed to generate new samples for the minority class. In our model-building approach, we divided the dataset into 80% training and 20% test sets, reserving 10% of the training set for validation. Our approach involved employing a DNN that integrates ReLU and sigmoid activation functions, incorporates batch normalization, and uses Adam optimization. The hyperparameters and architecture of the DNN were optimized through various tests on layers, minibatch sizes, epoch sizes, and learning rates. A 40% dropout rate was incorporated to mitigate overfitting. For model evaluation, we computed performance metrics, such as balanced accuracy (BACC), precision, recall, F1 score, Matthews’ correlation coefficient (MCC), and area under the curve (AUC).Results: The performance of the DNN across 11 bioassay test sets revealed varying outcomes, significantly influenced by the ratios of active-to-inactive compounds. Assays, such as AlphaLISA and CoV-PPE, demonstrated robust performance across various metrics, including BACC, precision, recall, and AUC, when configured with more balanced ratios (1:3 and 1:1, respectively). This suggests the effective identification of active compounds in both cases.

The rats were divided into four groups: control, SIL, PAX, and PAX + SIL, with seven in each group. The rats received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections at a dose of 2 mg per kilogram of body weight of PAX for 5 successive days, followed by oral gavage with 200 mg/ kg body mass of SIL for 10 uninterrupted days. We examined the effect of SIL on specific serum biochemical parameters using an autoanalyzer and rat-specific kits. The spectrophotometric methods was used to investigate oxidative stress indicators in kidney and liver tissues. Aquaporin-2 (AQP-2), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), cysteine aspartate-specific protease-3 (caspase-3), interleukin-6 (IL-6), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and streptavidin-biotin staining were used to assess immunoreactivity in PAX-induced liver and kidney injury models.Results: SIL treatment significantly reduced serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, urea, and C-reactive protein, indicating its effectiveness in treating PAX-induced liver and kidney injury. SIL treatment significantly reduced oxidative stress by increasing essential antioxidant parameters, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione. It also reduced malondialdehyde levels in liver and kidney tissues of SIL-PAX groups (p < 0.05). SIL administration reduced NF-κB, caspase-3, and IL-6 expression while increasing Bcl-2 and AQP2 levels in liver and kidney tissues of rats treated with SIL and PAX (p < 0.05).Conclusion: Our findings indicate the potential of SIL to alleviate PAX-induced liver and kidney damage in rats by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptotic processes.",

Patients aged > 18 years who presented with respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum, and dyspnea and were diagnosed with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis using computed tomography were included in the study. Demographic information, etiologies, comorbidities, pulmonary functions, and microbiological, radiological, and clinical data were collected from the patients.Results: Of the 1,035 study participants, 518 (50%) were females. The mean age of the patients was 56.1 ± 16.1 years. The underlying etiology was detected in 565 (54.6%) patients. While postinfectious origin was the most common cause of bronchiectasis (39.5%), tuberculosis was identified in 11.3% of the patients. An additional comorbidity was detected in 688 (66.5%) patients. The most common comorbidity was cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis was identified in 19.5% of the patients. The most commonly detected microbiological agent was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (29.4%). Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were used in 70.1% of the patients, and the frequency of exacerbations in the last year was significantly higher in patients using ICS than in nonusers (p < 0.0001).

Mortality rates were higher in patients with COPD than in those with no COPD (21.7-9.1%, p = 0.016). Patients with bronchiectasis and COPD exhibited more frequent exacerbations, exacerbation-related hospitalizations, and hospitalization in the intensive care unit in the previous year than patients without COPD.Conclusion: This is the first multicenter study of bronchiectasis in Türkiye. The study results will provide important data that can guide the development of health policies in Türkiye on issues such as infection control, vaccination, and the unnecessary use of antibiotics and steroids.",

Age [odds ratio (OR): 1.028; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.005-1.051], cachexia (OR: 4.774; 95% CI: 2,054-11,097), high modified medical research council dyspnea scale score (OR: 1,952; 95% CI: 1,459-2,611), presence of chronic renal failure (OR: 4,172; 95% CI: 1,249-13,938) and use of inhaled steroids (OR: 2,587; 95% CI: 1,098-6,098) were significant risk factors for mortality. Mortality rates were higher in patients with COPD than in those with no COPD (21.7-9.1%, p = 0.016). Patients with bronchiectasis and COPD exhibited more frequent exacerbations, exacerbation-related hospitalizations, and hospitalization in the intensive care unit in the previous year than patients without COPD.Conclusion: This is the first multicenter study of bronchiectasis in Türkiye. The study results will provide important data that can guide the development of health policies in Türkiye on issues such as infection control, vaccination, and the unnecessary use of antibiotics and steroids.",

Patients were divided into two groups: CD8+-TILlow (< 35%) and CD8+-TILhigh (≥ 35%) groups. US and MRI features were evaluated using the BI-RADS lexicon, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was calculated using RadiAnt software. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed the optimal US and MRI features for predicting CD8+-TIL levels. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and the Delong test were used to compare the diagnostic performance of US and MRI features. Furthermore, implementing a nomogram will increase clinical utility.Results: Univariate analysis of US features showed significant differences in shape, orientation, and posterior echo between the two groups; however, there were no significant differences in margins, internal echo, and microcalcification. Multifactorial analysis revealed that shape, orientation, and posterior echo were independent risk factors, with odds ratios of 11.62, 2.70, and 0.16, respectively. In terms of MRI features, ADC was an independent predictor of CD8+-TIL levels. These three US features and the ADC performed well, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.802 and 0.705, respectively. The combination of US and ADC values had higher predictive efficacy (AUC = 0.888) than either US or ADC alone (p = 0.009, US_ADC vs. US; p < 0.001, US_ADC vs. ADC).Conclusion: US features (shape, orientation, and posterior echo) and ADC value may be a valuable tool for estimating CD8+-TIL levels in HER2-positive BC.
