To determine the prevalence of inappropriate combination use in daily practice, all patients who had a history of atherosclerotic disease (ischemic heart disease, peripheral artery disease) or cerebrovascular disease (n=1498) were excluded. The data of 3489 patients were analyzed. We defined inappropriate combination as all patients who received aspirin and warfarin regardless of the indication for warfarin use, under the direction of the European Society of Cardiology guideline recommendation.Results: The mean age of patients was 59.2±13.8 years (41.8% male). The prevalence of the inappropriate use of warfarin and aspirin combination was 20.0%. The prevalence of combination therapy in patients with a primary indication for mechanical heart valve, non-valvular atrial fibrillation, and other reasons was 20.5%, 18.7%, and 21.0%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age (odds ratio, 1.009; 95% confidence interval, 1.002-1.015; p=0.010), heart failure (odds ratio, 1.765; 95% confidence interval, 1.448-2.151; p<0.001), smoking (odds ratio, 1.762; 95% confidence interval, 1.441-1.153; p<0.010), chronic kidney disease (odds ratio, 2.057; 95% confidence interval, 1.494-2.833; p<0.001), and deep vein thrombosis (odds ratio, 0.463; 95% confidence interval, 0.229-0.718; p=0.001) were independent predictors of combination therapy (r2=0.66). The mean time in therapeutic range of patients receiving combination therapy was significantly lower than in those on warfarin monotherapy (51.6±27.05 vs. 54.7±23.93; p=0.006). Overall, 19.4% (n=677) of patients had a bleeding event (major bleeding 13.0%, n=88) within a year. Percentages of patients with combination therapy were significantly higher in patients with major bleeding than in patients without major bleeding (29.5% vs. 19.7%; p=0.023).Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that 20.0% of patients taking warfarin use concomitant aspirin inappropriately in daily practice.

Although there are data regarding the molecular pathology of multiple myeloma, the molecular mechanisms of the disease have not been fully elucidated.Aims: To investigate the gene expression profiles in bone marrow myeloma cells via RNA-sequencing technology.Study Design: Cell study.Methods: Myeloma cells from four patients with untreated multiple myeloma and B cells from the bone marrow of four healthy donors were sorted using a FACSAria II flow cytometer. The patient pool of myeloma cells and the control pool of B cells were the two comparative groups. A transcriptome analysis was performed and the results were analyzed using bioinformatics tools.Results: In total, 18.806 transcripts (94.4%) were detected in the pooled multiple myeloma patient cells.

The experimental groups were acutely treated with 10, 100, and 1000 nM doses of chemerin. Another group was given 10 μM L-nitric oxide synthase inhibitor for 5 min before 1000 nM chemerin administration.

In addition, 1000 nM chemerin reduced the coronary flow (max 31 ∆%, p<0.001). N(W)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester antagonized the negative inotropic effect of chemerin on contractility.

    "previewText": "Abstract Background: Chemerin is a novel chemoattractant adipokine expressed in cardiovascular system, and its receptor has been detected in the epicardial adipose tissue.Aims: To determine the effects of chemerin on the cardiac parameters and gene expressions in the isolated perfused rat heart.Study Design: Animal experiment.Methods: The hearts were retrogradely perfused with Langendorff technique to measure the cardiac parameters. The experimental groups were acutely treated with 10, 100, and 1000 nM doses of chemerin. Another group was given 10 μM L-nitric oxide synthase inhibitor for 5 min before 1000 nM chemerin administration. The real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed for detecting the expression of target genes.Results: All doses of chemerin significantly decreased the left ventricular developed pressure (max 35.33 ∆%, p<0.001), and +dP/dtmax (max 31.3 ∆%, p<0.001), which are the indexes of cardiac contractile force. In addition, 1000 nM chemerin reduced the coronary flow (max 31 ∆%, p<0.001). N(W)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester antagonized the negative inotropic effect of chemerin on contractility. Chemerin induced a 2.16-fold increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA and increased the cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels (p<0.001) but decreased the PI3Kγ gene expression (1.8-fold, p<0.001). Furthermore, all doses of chemerin decreased the CaV1.2 gene expression (1.69-fold, p<0.001).Conclusion: Acute chemerin treatment induces a negative inotropic action with the involvement of nitric oxide pathway, CaV1.2, and PI3Kγ on isolated rat heart.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: This report produces a bibliographic study of psychophysical tests proposed clinical assessments of retronasal olfaction.Aims: We review how these tests can be utilized and discuss their methodological properties.Study Design: Systematic review.Methods: We undertook a systematic literature review investigating the retronasal olfaction test methods. PubMed, the free online MEDLINE database on biomedical sciences, was searched for the period from 1984 to 2015 using the following relevant key phrases: “retronasal olfaction”, “orthonasal olfaction”, “olfaction disorders”, and “olfaction test”. For each of the selected titles cited in this study, the full manuscript was read and analyzed by each of the three authors of this paper independently before collaborative discussion for summation and analytical reporting. Two reviewers independently read the abstracts and full texts and categorised them into one of three subgroups as follow, suitable, not-suitable, and unsure. Then they cross-checked the results, and a third reviewer decided assigned the group “unsure” to either the suitable group or the not-suitable group. Fifty eight studies revealed as suitable for review by two authors whereas 13 found not suitable for review. The total amount of 60 uncertain (unsure) or differently categorized articles were further examined by the third author which resulted in 41 approvals and 19 rejections. Hence 99 approved articles passed the next step. Exclusion criteria were reviews, case reports, animal studies, and the articles of which methodology was a lack of olfaction tests. By this way excluded 69 papers, and finally, 30 original human research articles were taken as the data.Results: The study found that the three most widely used and accepted retronasal olfaction test methods are the retronasal olfaction test, the candy smell test and odorant presentation containers. All of the three psychophysical retronasal olfaction tests were combined with orthonasal tests in clinical use to examine and understand the smell function of the patient completely. There were two limitations concerning testing: “the lack concentrations and doses of test materials” and “performing measurements within the supra-threshold zone”.Conclusion: The appropriate test agents and optimal concentrations for the retronasal olfaction tests remain unclear and emerge as limitations of the retronasal olfaction test technique. The first step to overcoming these limitations will probably require identification of retronasal olfaction thresholds. Once these are determined, the concept of retronasal olfaction and its testing methods may be thoroughly reviewed.",
