The major roles of MRI will continue to expand and its emerging use in standard of care approaches becomes more clearly defined and supported by increasing levels of data. Active surveillance has gained popularity as an acceptable management option for men with low-risk prostate cancer. Successful utilization of this strategy can delay or prevent unnecessary interventions - thereby reducing morbidity associated with overtreatment. The usefulness of active surveillance primarily depends on correct identification of patients with low-risk disease. However, current population-wide algorithms and tools do not adequately exclude high-risk disease, thereby limiting the confidence of clinicians and patients to go on active surveillance. Novel imaging tools such as mpMRI provide information about the size and location of potential cancers enabling more informed treatment decisions.

During cochlear implantation, there may be facial nerve abnormalities, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, electrode misplacement or difficulty in finding the cochlea itself. During the surgery for inner ear malformations, surgeon must be ready to modify the surgical approach or choose special electrodes for surgery.

    "abstract": "Background: Endotel dysfunction, vasoconstriction, and oxidative stress are described in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia, but its aetiology has not been revealed clearly. Aims: To examine whether there is a difference between the placentas of pre-eclamptic pregnant women and those of a control group in terms of their T2 star values. Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: Twenty patients diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and 22 healthy controls were included in this study. The placentas obtained after births performed via Caesarean section were taken into the magnetic resonance imaging area in plastic bags within the first postnatal hour, and imaging was performed via modified DIXON-Quant sequence. Average values were obtained by performing T2 star measurements from four localisations on the placentas. Results: T2 star values measured in the placentas of the control group were found to be significantly lower than those in the pre-eclampsia group (p<0.01). While the mean T2 star value in the pre-eclamptic group was found to be 37.48 ms (standard deviation ± 11.3), this value was 28.74 (standard deviation ± 8.08) in the control group. The cut-off value for the T2 star value, maximising the accuracy of diagnosis, was 28.59 ms (area under curve: 0.741; 95% confidence interval: 0.592-0.890); sensitivity and specificity were 70% and 63.6%, respectively. Conclusion: This study, the T2 star value, which is an indicator of iron amount, was found to be significantly lower in the control group than in the pre-eclampsia group. This may be related to the reduction in blood flow to the placenta due to endothelial dysfunction and vasoconstriction, which are important in pre-eclampsia pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Background: Atrial fibrillation is the most common clinically significant arrhythmia. It is now established that atrial high-rate episodes are highly correlated with atrial fibrillation. Aims: To investigate the relation between diastolic electrocardiographic parameters and subclinical atrial fibrillation detected by cardiac implantable electronic devices. Study Design: Ccross-sectional study. Methods: A total of 203 patients who had a dual-chamber, rate-modulated pacing pacemaker implanted due to sinus node dysfunction were prospectively enrolled in this study. Atrial high-rate episodes were defined as any lasting more than 5 min with an atrial rate of ≥220 beats per minute during the previous year. Patient groups were categorized on the basis of pacemaker interrogation as the absence of atrial high-rate episodes [atrial high-rate episodes (-)] and the presence of atrial high-rate episodes [atrial high-rate episodes (+)]. Episodes related to atrial over sensing were excluded. Twelve-lead surface electrocardiography was independently analyzed by two experienced readers for the measurement of diastolic electrocardiography parameters. Results: Among 203 patients (mean age: 67.5±9.1, 60.1% male), 51 (25.1%) with atrial high-rate episodes were defined as group 1 and 152 (74.9%) without atrial high-rate episodes were defined as group 2. Both groups were similar in terms of demographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors. Tend-Q and Tend-P were significantly longer in group 2. PQ interval was statistically longer in group 1. Corrected QT interval was significantly longer in group 1. Diastolic electrocardiography index, heart rate and PQ and QT intervals were the only independent predictors of atrial high-rate episodes in patients with dual pacemakers in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Abnormal diastolic electrocardiography parameters are powerful predisposing factors for the initiation of incident atrial fibrillation. Diastolic electrocardiography parameters and a novel diastolic index predict atrial high-rate episodes. Evaluating these parameters enables clinicians to identify patients who are at high risk and who may benefit from prophylactic treatment.",

    "abstract": "Background: Proximal femoral fracture rates are increasing due to osteoporosis and traffic accidents. Proximal femoral nails are routinely used in the treatment of these fractures in the proximal femur. Aims: To compare various combinations and to determine the ideal proximal lag screw position in pertrochanteric fractures (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen classification 31-A1) of the femur by using optimized finite element analysis. Study Design: Biomechanical study. Methods: Computed tomography images of patients\" right femurs were processed with Mimics. Afterwards a solid femur model was created with SolidWorks 2015 and transferred to ANSYS Workbench 16.0 for response surface optimization analysis which was carried out according to anterior-posterior (-10°<anterior-posterior<10°), inferior-superior (-6°<inferior-superior<7°) and tip-apex distance (10 mm<tip-apex distance<30 mm) proximal lag screw positions in the fracture region. The optimum position of the proximal lag screw was determined based on the von Mises stress values occurring on the fracture line. Initial analysis of the system was realized under the surgeon\"s normal positioning conditions (anterior-posterior, inferior-superior=0°; tip-apex distance=12 mm). Results: The maximum and minimum (compression) von Mises stresses were found to be 438 MPa and 0.003 MPa, respectively, and risky stresses for the system occurred in the regions where the proximal lag screw passes through the proximal femoral nail hole, the small diameter portion of stem joints with a large diameter and lag screw mounts to the stem. The most suitable position of the proximal lag screw was found at the middle position of the tip-apex distance (20 mm) and femoral neck (anterior-posterior, inferior-superior=0°), according to von Mises compression stress values occurring on the fracture line. Conclusion: In our study, we couldn\"t find any correlation between proximal lag screw movement and tip-apex distance on stresses of the fracture surfaces, but the proximal lag screw position in the inferior (inferior-superior<0)-superior (inferior-superior>0) and posterior-anterior directions of the femur neck significantly increased these stresses.

Aims: To demonstrate antibiotic resistance in urinary tract infections and changing ratio in antibiotic resistance by years. Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: We analysed antibiotic resistance patterns of isolated Gram (-) bacteria during the years 2011-2014 (study period 2) in children with urinary tract infections. We compared these findings with data collected in the same centre in 2001-2003 (study period 1). Results: Four hundred and sixty-five uncomplicated community-acquired Gram (-) urinary tract infections were analysed from 2001-2003 and 400 from 2011-2014. Sixty-one percent of patients were female (1.5 girls : 1 boy). The mean age of children included in the study was 3 years and 9 months. Escherichia coli was the predominant bacteria isolated during both periods of the study (60% in study period 1 and 73% in study period 2). Bacteria other than E. coli demonstrated a higher level of resistance to all of the antimicrobials except trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than E. coli bacteria during the years 2011-2014.

Urinary pathogens showed a decreasing trend for nitrofurantoin (from 17% to 7%, p=0.0001). No significant trends were detected for ampicillin (from 69% to 71%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (from 44% to 43%), cefazolin (from 39% to 32%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (from 32% to 31%), cefuroxime (from 21% to 18%) and ceftriaxone (from 10% to 14%) between the two periods (p>0.05).

Aims: To determine the effectiveness of the modified Mallampati test; the interincisor, sternomental and thyromental distances and the upper limb bite test. The second aim was to assess the effectiveness of the combination of the upper limb bite test with the other tests in obstetric patients. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Pregnant women (n=250) scheduled for caesarean section were analysed. The patients\" ages, heights and weights were collected. Preoperative airway evaluation was done by using a modified version of the Mallampati test. The interincisor, sternomental and thyromental distances were measured, and the upper limb bite test was performed. The laryngoscopy difficulty was evaluated by using Cormack-Lehane classification. Results: No statistically significant differences were found between groups in age, height or weight (p>0.05). The modified Mallampati test and interincisor, sternomental and thyromental distances revealed a lower number of easy intubations than that determined by the Cormack-Lehane classification and a higher number of difficult intubations than the actual number of cases (p<0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of the modified Mallampati test, the upper limb bite test, the interincisor distance test and the sternomental and thyromental distance tests were found to be 73.08, 57.69, 84.62, 80.77 and 88.46 and 90.62, 99.11, 83.04, 84.37 and 87.05, respectively. When the combinations were examined, the sensitivity and specificity of the combination of the upper limb bite test with the modified Mallampati test were found to be 57.69 and 100, respectively. When the upper limb bite test was combined with the interincisor distance, the sensitivity and specificity were 46.15 and 100, respectively. We found a sensitivity and specificity of 93.75 and 95.30, respectively, for the combination of the upper limb bite test with the thyromental distance test.

Administration of apigenin has no significant protective effect on ovarian reserve and tissue damage in ovarian ischemia/reperfusion injury Background: Apigenin is a plant-derived compound belonging to the flavone class, which possess antioxidant, free-radical-scavenging and anti-inflammatory properties. Aims: To address the effects of apigenin on serum anti-mullerian hormone levels, tissue oxidative stress parameters and histopathological changes in ovarian ischemia/reperfusion injury.

Methods: Twenty-eight female Wistar albino rats were randomly separated into four sections: Sham operation (group 1), ischemia/reperfusion plus saline (group 2), ischemia/reperfusion plus dimethyl sulfoxide (group 3) and ischemia/reperfusion plus apigenin (group 4). In all ischemia/reperfusion groups, a bilateral adnexal 3-h period of ischemia was performed, followed by 3-h of reperfusion. A single dose of 15 mg/kg apigenin was given intraperitoneally 60 min before reperfusion in group 4. After 3-h of reperfusion, both ovaries were removed, and blood samples were collected. The main outcome measures were serum anti-mullerian hormone levels, ovarian tissue malondialdehyde, total nitric oxide, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione levels and histopathological damage scores. Results: The ovarian tissue nitric oxide level was significantly lower, and the glutathione level was significantly higher in group 4 compared with groups 2 and 3. There was no significant difference in anti-mullerian hormone levels among the three ischemia/reperfusion groups.

    "abstract": "Background:After resection, specimens are subjected to formalin fixation during histologic processing. This procedure can result in tissue shrinkage, with amount of shrinkage related to tissue composition and tissue type. Aims: In this study,we aimed to evaluated shrinkage of nasal mucosa and cartilage tissue and compared differences in shrinkage after resection, after formalin fixation, and during microscopic examination to understand differences in rate of shrinkage with different tissue types. Study Design:Animal experimentation. Methods:Fresh sheep nasal septa were excised (10 mm diameter in 40 sheep and 20 mm diameter in 40 sheep). The mucosa was separated from 1 side of the cartilage, with the contralateral mucosa remaining attached to the cartilage. Specimen diameters were measured in situ, after resection, after fixation for 6 or 24 hours (10% formalin), and during microscopic examination. Results:We found no significant changes in specimen diameters (both 10 mm and 20 mm) between in situ and resected tissue. Shrinkage was noted in all fixated specimens, and further shrinkage was noted after microscopic examination. We found p=0.004 for free mucosa, p=0.005 for mucosa attached to cartilage, and p=0.008 for cartilage in 10 mm, and p=0.007 for free mucosa, p=0.004 for mucosa attached to cartilage, and p=0.01 for cartilage in 20 mm specimen diameter. Tissue shrinkage was greatest in free mucosal tissue and least in cartilage. Conclusion: We found that tissue shrinkage was greatest in free mucosal tissue, less in mucosa attached to cartilage, and least in cartilage. These results should be considered when evaluating patients undergoing surgical procedures fornasal cavity and paranasal sinus malignancies. Surgical margins should be measured before fixation or evaluated if possible before fixation and shrinkage.",

    "abstract": "Aims: To evaluate the impact of a histologically inverted pattern on recurrence in patients with newly diagnosed non-invasive, low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Methods: A total of 81 patients with primary bladder non-invasive, low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma diagnosed in a single tertiary-care centre who had at least 1-year follow-up after an initial resection were included. All slides from each case were reviewed to determine the growth pattern (exophytic versus endophytic, i.e. inverted) and other histological parameters. Clinical data were retrieved from hospital records. Results: Disease recurrence occurred in 41 (50.6%) patients. Cases with an inverted pattern showed a lower recurrence rate than those with pure exophytic tumours (37.5% versus 52.1%), a longer time to first recurrence (mean 34 versus 21.5 months) and fewer recurrence episodes (p=0.482, 0.564 and 0.051, respectively). All recurring inverted cases recurred only once during follow-up. No tumour with >80% inverted architecture recurred. Conclusion: Our results suggest that non-invasive, low-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma of the bladder tends to have a better outcome in terms of disease recurrence if it shows an inverted growth pattern. To indicate the presence and percentage of the inverted pattern in low-grade urothelial carcinomas in the pathology report might be considered as an adjunct to help long-term patient management.",

Case Report: We present a patient with an abdominal blunt trauma. An initial abdominal computed tomography scan revealed a rupture of the right kidney and of the liver. Two days later, his physical state deteriorated and a new computed tomography scan was obtained. An extremely large 8-centimetre liver abscess was verified. Due to the unsatisfying response to antibiotic therapy and percutaneous drainage, we operated on the patient. An appendectomy, cholecystectomy and bisegmental liver resection were performed. An intraoperative swab from the abscess was positive for Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. The patient was given intravenous ciprofloxacine. The post-operative course was complicated by a Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus infection of the wound, which improved with antibiotic therapy.
