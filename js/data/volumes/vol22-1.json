    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: We compared the effects of total intravenous anesthesia and inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane on intra-abdominal pressure and cardiovascular and respiratory systems in patients undergoing surgery in the supine and prone positions. Study Design: Thirty ASA I-II patients (17 males, 13 females; mean age 50 years; range 35 to 70 years) undergoing elective lumbar discectomy were randomly assigned to total intravenous anesthesia (group I, n=15) and inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane (group II, n=15). In group I, after anesthesia induction with intravenous alfentanil and propofol, entubation was performed with atracurium. Anesthesia was maintained with alfentanil and decreasing doses of propofol. In group II, induction was obtained with intravenous propofol, entubation with atracurium, and maintenance with sevoflurane. Intra-abdominal pressure, arterial pressures, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, and endtidal CO2 were monitored and recorded in the supine position before and after anesthesia induction, immediately after turning to the prone position, every 30 minutes throughout the operation, and immediately after extubation in the supine position. Results: At all times of monitoring, no significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to intraabdominal pressure, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. Conclusion: Total intravenous anesthesia and sevoflurane anesthesia do not appear to affect intra-abdominal pressure, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters in both positions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Oxidative stress has been implicated in the occurrence of myocardial injury during ischemia-reperfusion. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of basal total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) on ischemiareperfusion injury. Patients and Methods: Blood samples were taken from the coronary sinus of 21 patients prior to coronary bypass (basal), at the end of ischemia, five minutes after the removal of the cross clamp (early reperfusion), and 15 minutes after the removal of the lateral clamp (late reperfusion). The levels of TAOC, lipid peroxide (LPO), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were determined. The patients were divided into two groups as follows: group I included 10 patients (8 males, 2 females, mean age 57 years) with TAOC <%60 and group II included 11 patients (10 males, 1 female, mean age 53 years) with TAOC ≥%60. Results: The levels of LDH and LPO increased, while those of TAOC were suppressed in both groups throughout surgery. The levels of LDH and LPO were higher in group I than those of group II. The TOAC levels in group I were invariably and significantly lower than those of group II (for basal, ischemia, early reperfusion periods, p<0.001; late reperfusion, p<0.05). Inverse relationships were found between the basal TOAC and LPO at all the periods, and with LDH in the late reperfusion period. Conclusion: Our data suggest that basal TAOC values may be associated with ischemia-reperfusion injury and the degree of ensuing myocardial damage.",

The purpose of this study was to determine some body proportions in football players. Study Design: Anthropometric measurements were performed in 28 football players (mean age 20.6 years) who were students of the School of Sport Sciences. Measurements covered the following: body height, sitting altitude, biacromial, bideltoid, bispinal, and bitrochanteric diameters. Results: The ratio of sitting altitude to height was found as 53.57%. In the breadth of shoulders, biacromial and bideltoid diameters and the breadth of chest were s 36.88 cm, 43.57 cm, and 28.64 cm respectively. Concerning the breadth of pelvis, bicristal, bispinal, and bitrochanteric diameters were 27.55 cm, 25.89 cm, and 30.98 cm, respectively. Conclusion: According to the anthropometric indices, body constitution of football players comprises a long trunk, a proportional trunk build according to the acromial-iliac index, and a narrow hip according to the hip index.",

The main pathophysiologic changes in this disease are obstruction of expiratory airways and/or pathologic alterations in the lung parenchyma. Many factors are associated with decreased exercise tolerance, including increased airway resistance, inadequate ventilation, increased elastic loading of ventilation, hyperinflation, gas exchange abnormalities, mechanical weakness of respiratory muscles, and varying degrees of disturbances in the central and peripheral nervous systems due to hypoxic response. Skeletal muscles also undergo pathological changes similar to those in ventilation muscles.
