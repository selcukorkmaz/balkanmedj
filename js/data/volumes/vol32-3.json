    "abstract": "Abstract Luck Egalitarianism has frequently been discussed in the recent literature because of the potential impact of this theory on health financing. Luck Egalitarianism puts forth a theory of distributive justice which says that the fundamental aim of equality is to compensate people for undeserved bad luck such as being born with poor native endowments, having difficult family circumstances or suffering from accidents and illness. On the other hand, if individuals face ill health because of faults of their own, then society has no duty to supply health services to them. Many arguments for and against this theory have been raised since it was first introduced. The proponents of Luck Egalitarianism focus on the concepts that free choice and respecting the autonomy of the individual determine whether health services are deserved. The criticisms against the concept of Luck Egalitarianism are that it is harsh to the needy and abandons the wretched, discriminates against the disabled, is against basic humanitarian principles, is incompatible with human dignity, and is in dissonance with real life. We agree with the basic proposition of Luck Egalitarian theory, which states that “inequalities deriving from unchosen features of people’s circumstances are unjust and therefore should be compensated for”. Our agreement leads us to an opposite conclusion. We propose that the “unchosen features of people’s circumstances” include more than personal disadvantages. The social features to be included in the context of inequalities deriving from unchosen features of peoples circumstances are, socioeconomic status (SES), access to social determinants of health, and the ethnic, cultural and religious identity of individuals. Our other propositions are the mutable character of choices which makes individual responsibility of preferences implausible; the problematic causal relationship between responsibility and ill-health; the disregard of the motives behind decisions; problems with implementation in real health service circumstances; and the contradictory nature of Luck Egalitarianism for principles of medical ethics. These arguments draw attention to possible ethical and practical consequences of implementation of health policies arising from Luck Egalitarian view for patients and for health care providers. In this paper, we will first define Luck Egalitarianism. Then, we will discuss arguments for and against the theory in the literature.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Male infertility is a common and complex problem and, despite much research in this field, the major cause of infertility unfortunately remains unknown. Genital infection and varicocele are important causes of infertility. Aims: To compare the influence of genital infection and varicocele individually on male infertility based on semen analysis. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: The study included 120 infertile patients divided into two groups according to the presence of genital infection or varicocele. The first group included 60 examinees with proven genital infection, but without varicocele formation. The second included 60 patients with varicocele, regardless of the varicocele grade, but without genital infection. The fertile parameters were compared and an assessment was performed on the impact on quality of spermatogenesis due to infection and varicocele. Results: There is a statistically significant difference regarding abnormal forms of spermatozoids (45.94±9.79 vs. 25.27±6.54) and progressive motility (8.15±1.24 vs. 24.95±7.2), between two groups of patients. However, acidity of ejaculates, minimum sperm concentration, total spermatozoid motility and ejaculate volume showed no statistically significant difference. Conclusion: The study showed a stronger negative influence of genital infection on fertile parameters over varicocele. The significance of our study is the lack of contemporary researches comparing varicocele and genital infection influence on male infertility individually.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The scar tissue formed by episiotomy during vaginal delivery, and the related pain, is very frequent. The change in the normal anatomy can cause cosmetic and physiologic problems. It can affect and cause deterioration in sexual functions. Therefore, making the right diagnosis and applying the right surgical procedures are very important. Aims: Our aim was to examine the effect of the perineoplasty operation on the sexual dysfunctions that present due to vaginal delivery. Study Design: Self-controlled study. Methods: Forty patients, who attended our clinic between April 2012 and May 2013, and who were between the ages of 20 and 50 years, were included in the study. The patients had complaints of scar tissue in the perineum and various sexual dysfunctions after vaginal delivery, and they were suitable for perineoplasty. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire was applied to the patients before and 6 months after the operation, and the results were compared. Results: After the perineoplasty operation, there was a statistically significant improvement in the patients in the domains of sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction (p<0.005). However, there was no significant improvement in the feeling of pain during sexual intercourse (p=0.184). The mean±SD total FSFI score increased significantly after the operation (p<0.005). Conclusion: The sexual dysfunctions that develop due to perineal damage during vaginal delivery can benefit significantly from the perineoplasty operation if the indications are correct. However, vaginal perineoplasty did not provide an improvement in dyspareunia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The use of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) for the retreatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without a sustained virological response (SVR) prior to PegIFN/RBV treatment has resulted in low success rates. Aims: To investigate the efficacy and safety of telaprevir (TVR) in combination with PegIFN/RBV in patients infected with HCV genotypes 1 and 4 who were previously treated with PegIFN/RBV and failed to achieve SVR. Study Design: Multi-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study. Methods: The study included 111 patients: 80 prior relapsers, 25 prior null responders, and six prior partial responders to PegIFN/RBV treatment. The patients were given TVR/PegIFN/RBV for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week PegIFN/RBV treatment; virological response results were assessed at weeks 4, 12, and 24. Treatment was discontinued in patients with HCV RNA >1000 IU/mL at week 4 or with negative RNA results at week 4 but >1000 IU/mL at week 12. Rapid virological response (RVR), early virological response (EVR), extended rapid virological response (eRVR), and virological response at 24th week of treatment were evaluated. The side effects of combination therapy and the rates of treatment discontinuation were investigated. Results: The mean age of the patients was 56.02±9.96 years and 45.9% were male. Ninety-one percent of the patients were infected with viral genotype 1, 69.6% with the interleukin (IL) 28B genotype CT and 20.2% were cirrhotic. The RVR rate was 86.3% in prior relapsers, 56% in prior null responders, and 50% in prior partial responders (p=0.002). EVR rates in those groups were 91.3%, 56%, and 83.3%, respectively (p<0.001). eRVR rates were 83.8% in prior relapsers, 48% in prior null responders, and 50% in prior partial responders (<0.001). The virological response at the 24th week of treatment was found to be the highest in prior relapsers (88.8%); it was 56% in prior null responders and 66.7% in prior partial responders (p<0.001). Common side effects were fatigue, headache, anorexia, malaise, anemia, pruritus, dry skin, rash, dyspepsia, nausea, pyrexia, stomachache, and anorectal discomfort. All treatments were discontinued due to side effects in 9.9% of patients. Conclusion: High virological response rates were obtained with TVR/PegIFN/RBV treatment. Although side effects were frequently observed, the discontinuation rate of combination therapy was low.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is a widely-accepted diagnostic modality whose efficacy has been investigated by numerous past studies in the differentiation of malignant lesions from benign entities. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the characterization of renal lesions. Study Design: Diagnostic accuracy study. Methods: A total of 137 patients with renal lesions were included in this study. The median apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values as well as the b 800 and b 1600 signal intensities of normal kidneys, solid components of mixed renal masses, and total cystic lesions were evaluated. Results: There were significant differences between the ADC values of lesions and normal renal parenchyma, and between the ADC values of benign and malignant renal lesions on DWIs at b values of 800 and 1600 s/mm² (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). There were significant differences between the ADC values of Bosniak Category 1 and 2 cysts and the ADC values of Bosniak Category 1 and 3 cysts on DWIs at b values of 800 s/mm² (p<0.001) and 1600 s/mm2 (p<0.001). A cutoff value of 1.902 x 10-3 mm²/s for the ADC with a b value of 800 s/mm² provided 88% sensitivity and 96% specificity for differentiation between benign and malignant renal lesions. A cutoff value of 1.623 x 10-3 mm²/s for the ADC with a b value of 1600 s/mm² provided 79% sensitivity and 96% specificity (p<0.001) for the differentiation between benign and malignant renal lesions. Conclusion: Accurate assessment of renal masses is important for determining the necessity for surgical intervention. DWI provides additional value by differentiating benign from malignant renal tumors and can be added to routine kidney MRI protocols.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The influence of meteorological conditions on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been known for a long time. However, few reports have been published on the influence of meteorological parameters on the occurrence of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Aims: In this retrospective study, we compared the meteorological parameters between PE patients with risk factors and idiopathic PE patients. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Medical documentation of 1180 patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism diagnosed between January 2010 and December 2012 was retrospectively analyzed. A total of 530 patients with PE confirmed by computed tomography pulmonary angiography and/or ventilation/perfusion scan were included for further analysis.

The meteorological data were collected from the relevant time period: temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind velocity. As the exact time of PE onset was unknown, the meteorological values attributed to each patient were the means of the values in the months or weeks at the time of diagnosis of PE. Results: The highest numbers of cases were seen in autumn (29.8%), followed by summer (28.9%), spring (22.1%), and winter (19.2%). In terms of months, the greatest number of cases occurred in June (57), followed by November (56) and October (54).

The meteorological data were collected from the relevant time period: temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind velocity. As the exact time of PE onset was unknown, the meteorological values attributed to each patient were the means of the values in the months or weeks at the time of diagnosis of PE. Results: The highest numbers of cases were seen in autumn (29.8%), followed by summer (28.9%), spring (22.1%), and winter (19.2%). In terms of months, the greatest number of cases occurred in June (57), followed by November (56) and October (54). Case distribution according to the months and seasons were statistically significant. The wind direction also affected the incidence of PE. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between case frequency and air temperature (r=0.300; p=0.031). No correlation was found between the unprovoked PE cases’ monthly distribution and pressure, humidity, or temperature. However, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the monthly distribution of the group with provoked PE cases and air temperature (r=0.586; p=0.045). Conclusion: A statistically significant inverse correlation between atmospheric pressure and temperature and the number of all PE cases was observed in our study, which is in accordance with other reports. However, in unprovoked PE cases, there was no correlation between meteorological parameters and case incidence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Congenital cardiovascular abnormality is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in childhood. Both the type of congenital cardiovascular abnormality and cardiopulmonary bypass are responsible for gastrointestinal system problems. Aims: Intra-abdominal problems, such as paralytic ileus, necrotizing enterocolitis, and intestinal perforation, are common in patients who have been operated or who are being followed for congenital cardiovascular abnormalities. Besides the primary congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, ischemia secondary to cardiac catheterization or surgery contributes to the incidence of these problems. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: In this study, we aimed to screen the intra-abdominal problems seen in patients with congenital cardiovascular abnormalities who had undergone surgical or angiographical intervention(s). Patients with congenital cardiovascular abnormalities who had been treated medically or surgically between 2000 and 2014 were analyzed retrospectively in terms of intra-abdominal problems. The patients’ demographic data, type of congenital cardiovascular abnormalities, the intervention applied (surgical, angiographic), the incidence of intra-abdominal problem(s), the interventions applied for the intra-abdominal problems, and the results were evaluated. Results: Fourteen (Group I) of the 76 patients with congenital cardiovascular abnormalities diagnosis were operated due to intra-abdominal problems, and 62 (Group II) were followed-up clinically for intra-abdominal problems. In Group I (10 boys and 4 girls), 11 patients were aged between 0 and 12 months, and three patients were older than 12 months. Group II included 52 patients aged between 0 and 12 months and 10 patients older than 12 months. Cardiovascular surgical interventions had been applied to six patients in Group I and 40 patients in Group II. The most frequent intra-abdominal problems were necrotizing enterocolitis and intestinal perforation in Group I, and paralytic ileus in Group II. Seven of the Group I patients and 22 of the Group II patients died. The patients who died in both groups had more than three congenital cardiovascular abnormalities in the same patient, and 80% of these patients had been operated for congenital cardiovascular abnormalities. Conclusion: The gastrointestinal system is involved in important complications experienced by patients with congenital cardiovascular abnormalities. The mortality rate was higher in operated patients due to gastrointestinal complications. Gastrointestinal complications are more frequent in patients with cyanotic anomalies. The presence of more than one congenital cardiovascular abnormality in a patient increased the mortality rate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The exchange of substances between mother and fetus via the placenta plays a vital role during development. A number of developmental disorders in the fetus and placenta are observed during diabetic pregnancies. Diabetes, together with placental apoptosis, can lead to developmental and functional disorders.

    "abstract": "Abstract Arkaplan: Sitalopram, yüksek doz alımlarında rutin kardiyak izlem önerilen bir serotonin geri-alım inhibitörüdür. Akut sitalopram zehirlenmelerinde QT aralığında uzama gözlenir. Daha önceki deneysel çalışmamızda, sitalopramın, endojen adenozin salınımını etkilemeden, adenozin A1 reseptörlerinin uyarılmasına bağlı QT uzamasına neden olabileceği gösterilmiştir. Amaç: Sitaloprama bağlı kardiyovasküler toksik etkilerin geri döndürülmesinde selektif adenozin reseptör antagonistlerinin etkisinin araştırılmasıdır. Çalışma Tasarımı: Hayvan deneyi. Yöntemler: Sıçanlar randomize olarak üç gruba ayrıldı. Sıçanların tümüne, A3 reseptörlerine bağlı gelişen mast hücre aktivasyonunu engellemek için, sodyum kromoglikat (20 mg/kg) verildi. Sitalopram toksisitesi, 4 mg/kg/dk sitalopramın 20 dakika infüzyonu ile gerçekleştirildi. Sitalopram infüzyonundan sonra sıçanlara %5 dekstroz (kontrol, Grup 1, n=7) veya DPCPX (Grup 2, 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-Dipropylxanthine; selektif adenozin A1 reseptör antagonisti, 20 mg/kg/dk, n=7) veya CSC [Grup 3, 8-(3-chlorostyryl) caffeine; selektif adenozin A2a reseptör antagonisti, 24 μg/kg/min, n=7] 60 dk. boyunca infüzyon ile verildi. Ortalama arteriyel basınç (OAB), kalp atım hızı (KAH), QRS süreleri ve QT aralıkları kaydedildi. Bulgular: Sitalopram infüzyonu tüm gruplarda OAB ve KAH’ında anlamlı azalma, QT süresinde anlamlı uzama oluşturdu. Ancak, QRS süresinde anlamlı değişiklik oluşturmadı. Kontrol grubu ile karşılaştırıldığında, sitalopram sonrası infüze edilen DPCPX, 40., 50. ve 60. dakikalarda QT uzamasını anlamlı şekilde kısalttı (sırasıyla, p<0,01, p<0,01 ve p<0,001). CSC grubu ile karşılaştırıldığında, DPCPX infüzyonu QT aralığındaki uzamayı sadece 60. dakikada kısalttı. (p<0,05). Kontrol grubu ile karşılaştırıldığında CSC, QT aralığındaki uzamayı 60. dakikada kısalttı (p<0,05). İstatistiksel analizde ANOVA’yı takip eden Tukey çoklu karşılaştırma testleri kullanıldı. Sonuç: DPCPX, sıçanlarda sitalopram toksisitesine bağlı gelişen QT süresindeki uzamayı geri çevirdi. Bu sonuçlar, adenozin A1 reseptör uyarımının, sitaloprama bağlı gelişen kardiyovasküler toksisitenin patofizyolojisinde rolü olabileceğini düşündürmektedir.

The median arcuate ligament (MAL) is a fibrous arch that unites the diaphragmatic crura on either side of the aortic hiatus and, while it normally passes cranial to the origin of the celiac truncus, a low-lying ligament may lead to compression of the celiac artery and is the one of the major causes of CAS. Case Report: In this paper, we present a patient with a mass in the gastric bulbus who was diagnosed with celiac artery stenosis during the pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). MAL was the cause of the celiac artery stenosis, determined based on the findings of preoperative computed tomography (CT). Conclusion: Although CAS is usually asymptomatic due to the collateral blood supply, it may be associated with potentially disastrous results due to ischemia of the upper abdominal organs as a result of disruption of the collateral pathways.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDTCs) lie, both morphologically and behaviorally, between well-differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas. Metastasis of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma to the intranasal cavity has not been reported previously in the literature. Case Report: A 48-year-old male patient presented with massive epistaxis and nasal obstruction. On nasal examination, a bleeding, vascular mass was seen filling the left nasal cavity. The histopathological report of the nasal mass was well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma metastasis. Whole body scintigraphy, ultrasonography and positron emission tomography were done to rule out other possible metastases in the body and determine the origin of the tumor, which was identified as the left lobe of the thyroid gland, and there were multiple metastases involving the lung, sacroiliac area, and left humerus. Histopathological examination of a thyroidectomy specimen revealed PDTC consisting of insular, follicular, and papillary components. Postoperatively, the patient received radioactive iodine ablation therapy (iodine-131) and a course of external beam radiation therapy to the sacroiliac area and other metastatic regions. No recurrences were observed in a follow-up period of 5 years after surgery. Conclusion: The metastasis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma as a component of PDTC to the intranasal cavity has not been reported before. It is interesting that the well-differentiated component of the tumor was metastasized in our patient. Due to the aggressiveness of PDTC and the poor survival rates in patients who undergo surgery alone, a multidisciplinary treatment approach is required.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Background: Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDTCs) lie, both morphologically and behaviorally, between well-differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas. Metastasis of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma to the intranasal cavity has not been reported previously in the literature. Case Report: A 48-year-old male patient presented with massive epistaxis and nasal obstruction. On nasal examination, a bleeding, vascular mass was seen filling the left nasal cavity. The histopathological report of the nasal mass was well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma metastasis. Whole body scintigraphy, ultrasonography and positron emission tomography were done to rule out other possible metastases in the body and determine the origin of the tumor, which was identified as the left lobe of the thyroid gland, and there were multiple metastases involving the lung, sacroiliac area, and left humerus. Histopathological examination of a thyroidectomy specimen revealed PDTC consisting of insular, follicular, and papillary components. Postoperatively, the patient received radioactive iodine ablation therapy (iodine-131) and a course of external beam radiation therapy to the sacroiliac area and other metastatic regions. No recurrences were observed in a follow-up period of 5 years after surgery. Conclusion: The metastasis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma as a component of PDTC to the intranasal cavity has not been reported before. It is interesting that the well-differentiated component of the tumor was metastasized in our patient. Due to the aggressiveness of PDTC and the poor survival rates in patients who undergo surgery alone, a multidisciplinary treatment approach is required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Intragastric balloons have several advantages such as easy placement and low complication rates over other bariatric procedures. It is very rare for intragastric balloons to dislodge and give rise to pancreatitis. In this article, we present a case of duodenal obstruction caused by a gastric balloon leading to pancreatitis. Case Report: A 38-year-old obese female patient had undergone intragastric implantation one month before admission. The patient was admitted to our hospital because of sudden onset of abdominal pain. On the abdominal ultrasonography and tomography, edematous pancreatitis and cholelithiasis were observed. The patient was given medical treatment for pancreatitis. Abdominal ultrasonography was repeated on the next day, and a distended gallbladder was revealed. Thus, the patient was operated on with the pre-diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and biliary pancreatitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. During the operation, a hard and trapped object was determined in the second part of the duodenal lumen. The patient was reevaluated on the second postoperative day as her pain had increased. On direct abdominal X-ray and computed tomography scan, the tubular part of the gastric balloon was found to be stuck in the duodenum. A gastroscopy was performed, but the balloon could not be removed. Therefore, an immediate laparotomy was performed, and the balloon was removed via gastrotomy. Conclusion: Although intragastric balloons are designed to reduce the risk of displacement, all unexpected patient complaints should lead to a thorough examination of the position and status of the balloon.",
