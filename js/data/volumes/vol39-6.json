However, no study has investigated the factors affecting the mesenchymal stem cell population in adipose tissue derived stromal vascular fraction. Understanding the interaction of patient factors with the mesenchymal stem cell count and cell viability in adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction could provide crucial information for surgeons to improve patient selection and outcomes.Aims: To evaluate the factors affecting the mesenchymal stem cell count, total cell count, and cell viability in adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction.Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study.Methods: This study retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 30 patients who underwent liposuction to harvest adipose tissue-derived stromal vascular fraction at our stem cell center. Operative variables, such as lipoaspirate amount and donor areas from the stromal vascular fraction harvesting site, included the entire abdomen and lower abdomen. We recorded the mesenchymal stem cell population, cell viability, and cell count of stromal vascular fraction, and we analyzed the results to determine statistical significance.Results: The factors that were found to be significantly related are as follows; between cell number and age (p=0.001) and amount of lipoaspirate (p<0.001); between cell viability and body mass index (p=0.005) and hypertension (p=0.047); and between coronary artery disease and mesenchymal stem cell counts (p = 0.028).Conclusion: The relationship of patient factors (age, body mass index, hypertension, and coronary artery disease) with cell viability and mesenchymal stem cell counts may be important for clinical applications.

Cystic echinococcosis is still an important public health problem in Turkey, which is an endemic region.Aims: To genotype Echinococcus granulosus isolates and investigate antigen B gene polymorphism in Thrace, Turkey.Study Design: A cross-sectional study.Methods: Seventy-five hydatid cyst materials obtained between June 2020 and May 2021 were included in the study. Hydatid cyst materials were collected from 12 humans from various hospitals in Edirne and 63 from slaughterhouse animals during the same period. Cyst materials were localized in 8 livers and 4 lungs in humans, 23 livers and 17 lungs in cattle, and 13 livers and 10 lungs in sheep. In the first step, the 12S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction for all samples and run on an agarose gel. Band patterns were used for strain typing. Then, the selected samples that represented each of the band patterns obtained by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis were sequenced for AgB1, AgB2, mt-CO1, and mt-ND1 genes.Results: Three different genotypes in Edirne, Thrace, Turkey, were observed for Echinococcus granulosus: G1 (domestic sheep strain), G2 (Tasmanian sheep strain), and G3 (buffalo strain). G1 was the dominant genotype in Edirne, and G3 was the second most common. Additionally, polymorphism in AgB1 and AgB2 gene regions was found.Conclusion: This study is the first to report on Echinococcus granulosus G2 (Tasmania sheep strain) in Turkey and G3 (buffalo strain) and antigen B polymorphism in Thrace.

Western blot analyses of LASP1, PCNA, cleaved caspase 3, snail 1, and OCT4 protein expression were performed. CCK-8, EdU, flow cytometry, transwell assays, and sphere formation were conducted to evaluate colorectal cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and stemness. Luciferase reporter assays, RNA pull-down, and RIP validated binding. A nude mice xenograft model was constructed.Results: Circ_0001535 was significantly upregulated in colorectal tissues and cells. Circ_0001535 knockdown suppressed the malignant behavior of colorectal cells such as proliferation, invasion, stemness, and tumor growth in vivo. This knockdown also induced apoptosis by sponging miR-485-5p and upregulating LASP1 expression.Conclusion: Circ_0001535 promotes colorectal cancer cell development by absorbing miR-485-5p and upregulating LASP1.",

There is a strong suspicion that dysfunction of Dexras1 might contribute to the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases.

The c.722A>T was found in a single individual with schizophrenia and is a missense heterozygous variant in the second exon of RASD1, which is extremely rare in GnomAD.

Seven previously identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms were also detected; however, they were not significantly associated with schizophrenia in this study cohort.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that rare variants of RASD1 might be contributing to the etiopathogenesis of schizophrenia.

    "previewText": "Abstract Background: Extramural venous invasion is an independent predictor of poor outcome in colorectal cancer, whereas the significance of the intramural component of venous and lymphatic and perineural invasion is unclear.Aims: To evaluate the prognostic impact of intramural components for venous, lymphatic, and perineural invasions and the relation of these invasion patterns with clinicopathological features in patients with colon cancer.Study Design: A retrospective cross-sectional study.Methods: The analysis included 626 patients with colon cancer in stages II and III. All patients were divided into four categories (no invasion, intramural invasion only, extramural invasion only, or both intramural and extramural invasions) for vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion and perineural invasion. The primary outcomes were 5-year disease-free and overall survival.Results: Right-sided (for vascular invasion, 24.7% vs. 33.9%, p = 0.007; for perineural invasion, 34.5% vs. 41.5%, p = 0.034) and dMMR tumors (for vascular invasion, 13.5% vs. 33.5, p < 0.001; for perineural invasion, 25% vs. 41.4%, p = 0.004) exhibited less venous and perineural invasion. Compared with no invasion, presence of intramural invasion only, did not exert any effect on disease-free or overall survival for vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, and perineural invasion. Multivariate analyses revealed that the presence of both intramural and extramural invasion was independently associated with poor disease-free and overall survival for venous (hazard ratios: 2.39, p = 0.001; hazard ratios: 2.46, p = 0.001), lymphatic (hazard ratios: 2.456, p < 0.001; hazard ratios: 2.13, p = 0.02) and perineural invasion (hazard ratios: 2.99, p < 0.001; hazard ratios: 2.68, p < 0.001), respectively.Conclusion: Our data strongly advocates the importance of reporting intramural and extramural components of invasion since the presence of intramural invasion alone may not be considered as a high-risk factor for systemic recurrence.",
