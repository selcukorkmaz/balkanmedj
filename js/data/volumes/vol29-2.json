However, we shouldn't forget that the conventional surgical aortic valve replacement is still the gold standard therapy for severe aortic valve stenosis. For the patients who cannot be treated conventionally because of high risk comorbid diseases and older age, TAVI is an effective alternative therapy method. The indications should be limited, concerning the high mortality rate, 10% within 30 days of intervention. Long term efficacy data are still inadequate. Although the indications are restricted to older patients with a STS score >10 or log-Euro Score >20, age is not a definite indication for this treatment. The patients should be assessed by a heart team including a non-interventional cardiologist, interventional cardiologist, cardiac anesthesiologist and cardiac surgeon according to their general status, frailty and STS- Euro score. In other words, assessment and treatment of the patient by a heart team is the main factor besides the limited power of the scoring systems. The treatment should be applied to the patients with an aortic annulus diameter between 18-27 mm and a life expectancy of at least over 1 year. The currently ongoing investigations are focused on parameters like safety, efficiency and long term reliability of TAVI.

Material and Methods: A total number of 100 consecutive patients operated for nodular thyroid disease in our institution were included in this prospective study. In addition to classical pathological examinations, nodules and extranodular healthy tissues were sampled and immunochemically stained for IGF-1. The materials were independently evaluated using an Allred Scoring System ranging from 0 to 8. If the score was ≥1, the tissue was accepted as IGF-1 positive. Results: IGF-1 positivity was observed in 88% and 58% of the samples obtained from nodules and extranodular healthy tissues, respectively. Allred 8-unit scores were higher in benign nodules (n=89; 4.1±2.3) and papillary carcinomas (n=7; 6.7±1.3), than in extranodular healthy tissues in the same patients (2.3±2.3 and 3.3±1.9, respectively); and higher in papillary carcinomas than in benign nodules, when the scores were compared to each other (p<0.01 for all comparisons).

Allred 8-unit scores were higher in benign nodules (n=89; 4.1±2.3) and papillary carcinomas (n=7; 6.7±1.3), than in extranodular healthy tissues in the same patients (2.3±2.3 and 3.3±1.9, respectively); and higher in papillary carcinomas than in benign nodules, when the scores were compared to each other (p<0.01 for all comparisons). Conclusions: Allred 8-unit scores for IGF-1 increase in the presence of benign thyroid nodules, papillary cancer. The results of our study support the findings of previous studies demonstrating the role of IGF-1 in the development of thyroidal nodules.",

Erythrocyte zinc level, which affects hemorheological parameters, was also measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Results: Erythrocyte deformability was decreased in both study groups but the decrease in group A was not statistically significant. Exposure to EF did not have any significant effect on erythrocyte aggregation. On the other hand, erythrocyte zinc level was significantly reduced in both study groups. Conclusion: Exposure to EF may have decreased tissue oxygenation due to reduced erythrocyte deformability.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. There is ongoing research to find an effective preventive or treatment agent. We aimed to evaluate the effects of apelin 13 (AP) on intestinal I/R injury in a rat model. Material and Methods: Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 6-8 weeks and weighing 280±20 g were equally divided into three groups (control, I/R and I/R+AP). The control group underwent superior mesenteric artery (SMA) mobilization alone without any clamping. In the I/R and I/R+AP groups, an atraumatic microvascular bulldog clamp was placed across the SMA at its point of origin from the aorta. In the I/R+AP group, 2 μg/kg/d apelin was administered intraperitoneally. After 60 minutes of ischemia, relaparotomy was performed to remove the microvascular clamp on the SMA for 3 hours of reperfusion. After 3 hours, tissue samples were obtained for biochemical [malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) levels] and histopathological analyses. Results: MDA levels were significantly higher in the I/R group compared to the control group. Although MDA levels were lower in the I/R+AP group compared tothe I/R group, the difference was not statistically significant. There was also no significant difference between the I/R+AP and I/R groups regarding GSH levels. The median histopathological grade was significantly lower in the I/R+AP group compared to the I/R group (p=0.001). Conclusion: Apelin appeared to have a positive effect on oxidative injury; this did not reach statistical significance. Thus, the role of apelin and associated findings in the initial treatment of intestinal ischemia needs further large-scale animal studies before human use.",

Conclusion: Sex workers, like other people, should have human rights, all types of violence that they face should be eliminated and the social conditions they are exposed to should be improved. Sexually transmitted diseases, the most important health risk of sex workers, should be considered as occupational diseases in the new regulations.",

Materials and Methods: A total of 87 strains isolated between 2006 and 2009, eight of which were rifampicin monoresistant and 79 were multidrug resistant, were analyzed with IS6110 RFLP and spoligotyping methods. Results: The results of spoligotyping showed that 7% of the strains were orphans, and 8% were undefined for family in the SpolDB4 database. Major families of the strains were LAM (38%), T (35%), Haarlem (7%), Beijing (2%), S (2%) and U (1%) families. The clustering rate by spoligotyping was calculated as 75%. The most predominant SIT cluster was SIT41 (29%). According to the results of IS6110 RFLP, 71 different patterns of IS6110 were observed. Low copy number was found in 26% of the strains. When the results of two methods were combined, the final clustering rate was calculated as 26%.

Materials and Methods: Aortic valve replacement was performed in 40 patients with cryopreserved homograft. The indications were aortic valve endocarditis in 20 patients (50%), truncus arteriosus in 6 patients (15%), and re-stenosis or regurtitation after aortic valve reconstruction in 14 (35%) patients. The valve sizes ranged from 10 to 27mm. A full root replacement technique was used for homograft replacement in all patients. Results: The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 12.5% (5 patients). There were four late deaths. Only one of them was related to cardiac events. Overall mortality was 22.5%. Thirty-three patients were followed up for 67±26 months. Two patients needed reoperation due to aortic aneurysm caused by endocarditis. The mean transvalvular gradient significantly decreased after valve replacement (p<0.003). The last follow up showed that the 27 (82%) patients had a normal left ventricular function. Conclusion: Cryopreserved homografts are safe alternatives to mechanical valves that can be used when there are proper indications.

    "previewText": "Abstract Objective: We investigated whether determination IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha at baseline, total protein C (PC) levels at time of admission and 48 hours after initiation could complement the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scoring system to identify patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock for clinical outcome. Material and Methods: The study was carried out prospectively. 60 consecutive patients with sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock were included. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and 48 hours after initiation. Cytokines and PC levels in plasma were measured with an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). APACHE II score was calculated on admission. Results: Baseline IL-6 levels and PC levels 48 hours after initiation were predictive of increased mortality (p=0.016, p=0.044 respectively). Baseline IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha baseline levels correlate with the severity of physiologic insult, as determined by the APACHE II score. However, our multiple logistic regression analysis of these did not reveal any predictive value in combination with the APACHE II score. Conclusion: Determination of baseline IL-6 and PC 48 hours after initiation were of predictive value for prognostic evaluation of septic patients, but did not significantly increase predictive power of the APACHE scoring system to identify patients with sepsis for fatal clinical outcome.",

Several methods have been proposed to prevent seroma, but none of these provided a significant effect. A prolonged wound healing process is the most important cause of seroma. Microporous polysaccharide hemospheres (MPH) are used to achieve hemostasis. They may also accelerate wound healing. In this study, the effects of MPH on seroma formation were investigated. Material and Methods: Female Wistar rats weighing between 200 g and 250 g were used. There were eight rats in each of the control and study groups. Right breast mastectomy and axillary dissection were performed in all rats. While no application was performed after the operation in the control group, MPH was locally applied to the surgical site in the study group. Ten days after the operation, seroma fluid was aspirated and the total volume was recorded. The aspirates were analyzed and tissue samples were obtained from the surgical site. Results: Seroma was significantly lower in the study group (p=0.001). The mean albumin and lactate dehydrogenase levels were significantly lower in the study group (p=0.003).

Although no known curative therapy exists, various specific treatments have been proposed in the literature. In this report, we describe five cases of scleredema partially treated with low-dose methotrexate therapy. All patients have diabetes mellitus type II. All patients were started on methotrexate 15 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 3 months. Biopsy specimens were taken from all patients and were examinated histologically before the treatment and after 3 months of treatment. All cases partially responded to low-dose methotrexate therapy. We believe that methotrexate therapy may be an alternative therapeutic options in scleredema in view of its efficacy.",

    "abstract": "An increase in triglyceride levels in familial hyperlipidemia during pregnancy has been reported. Severe hypertriglyceridemia can lead to complications such as acute pancreatitis, preeclampsia, maternal and fetal complications. Because of the teratogenic effects associated with fibrate therapy in pregnancy, alternative treatment strategies such as insulin as a rapid and potent activator of lipoprotein lipase are required during pregnancy. We report a case of hypertriglyceridemia in a 33-year-old pregnant woman in whom treatment with merely single one time administration of Neutral Protamine Hagedorn insulin was accompanied by a reduction in the serum triglyceride level; to the best of our knowledge, this has never been reported in the literature. Her triglyceride level was 3616 mg/dL before insulin treatment and 1246 mg/dL after insulin treatment. Although this regimen was used safely and effectively in our patient, comprehensive studies are required to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of subcutaneously intermediate-acting Neutral Protamine Hagedorn insulin for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia in non-diabetic pregnant women.",
