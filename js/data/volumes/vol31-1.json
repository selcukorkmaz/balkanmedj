    "abstract": "Abstract Tularemia is considered to have existed in Anatolia for several thousand years. There are suspicions regarding its use in biological warfare in the Neshite-Arzawan conflict. The causative agent of tularemia may have first been used as a biological weapon in 1320-1318 BC. The disease has recently become a significant re-emerging disease globally as well as in Turkey. In the period of 2001-2010, Kosovo had the highest annual incidence in Europe at a rate of 5.2 per 100,000. Sweden, Finland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Norway, Serbia-Montenegro, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Croatia follow with rates of 2.80, 1.19, 1.0, 0.81, 0.42, 0.4, 0.36, 0.21, and 0.15 per 100,000 people, respectively. Tularemia in Turkey was first reported in the soldiers living in the region very close to the Kaynarca Stream of Thrace in 1936. It has started to gain more and more importance, especially in recent decades in Turkey, due to a very high number of cases and its spread throughout the country. A total of 431 tularemia cases were recorded in Turkey in 2005, but a significant reduction was observed in the number of the cases in the next three years; the number of patients decreased to 71 in 2008. The number of cases increased again in 2009 and continued in subsequent years. The number of cases reached 428, 1531, 2151, and 607 in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively. The number of cases peaked in 2011 in Turkey, and was in fact higher than the total number of cases in all European Union countries. The number of cases is higher in females than males in Turkey. In Turkey, 52% of cases of tularemia diagnoses occur from December to March and the most common clinical presentation is the oropharyngeal form caused by contaminated water. Rodents are the most likely sources of tularemia outbreaks in Turkey as well as in Kosovo. Organisms such as ticks, flies and mosquitoes are vectors of tularemia transmission to mammals. Because ticks can carry the bacteria by both transovarial and transstadial transmission, they play a role in the life cycle of tularemia as both reservoir and vector.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Whole-body vibration (WBV) induces reflex muscle activity and leads to increased muscle strength. However, little is known about the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of whole-body vibration on muscular performance. Tonic vibration reflex is the most commonly cited mechanism to explain the effects of whole-body vibration on muscular performance, although there is no conclusive evidence that tonic vibration reflex occurs. The bone myoregulation reflex is another neurological mechanism used to explain the effects of vibration on muscular performance. Bone myoregulation reflex is defined as a reflex mechanism in which osteocytes exposed to cyclic mechanical loading induce muscle activity. Aims: The aim of this study was to assess whether bone tissue affected vibration-induced reflex muscle activity and vibration-induced muscle strength gain. Study Design: A prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial. Methods: Thirty-four participants were randomised into two groups. High-magnitude whole-body vibration was applied in the exercise group, whereas low-magnitude whole-body vibration exercises were applied in the control group throughout 20 sessions. Hip bone mineral density, isokinetic muscle strength, and plasma sclerostin levels were measured. The surface electromyography data were processed to obtain the Root Mean Squares, which were normalised by maximal voluntarily contraction. Results: In the exercise group, muscle strength increased in the right and left knee flexors (23.9%, p=0.004 and 27.5%, p<0.0001, respectively). However, no significant change was observed in the knee extensor muscle strength. There was no significant change in the knee muscle strength in the control group. The vibration-induced corrected Root Mean Squares of the semitendinosus muscle was decreased by 2.8 times (p=0.005) in the exercise group, whereas there was no change in the control group. Sclerostin index was decreased by 15.2% (p=0.031) in the exercise group and increased by 20.8% (p=0.028) in the control group. A change in the sclerostin index was an important predictor of a change in the vibration-induced normalised Root Mean Square of the semitendinosus muscle (R2=0.7, p=0.0001). Femoral neck bone mineral density was an important predictor of muscle strength gain (R2=0.26, p=0.035).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Euphrasia officinalis L. is an herb traditionally used in folk medicine, mainly in the treatment of eye disorders. Aims: The present study analyzed the activity of three extracts of E. officinalis L. (ethanol, ethyl acetate and heptane) on cultured human corneal epithelial cells (10.014 pRSV-T). Study Design: In vitro study. Methods: Toxicity, free radical scavenging activity and the immunomodulatory effects of the extracts were tested using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) or Neutral Red, 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ELISA tests, respectively. Moreover, nitric oxide levels and cytoskeleton architecture were analyzed after corneal cell incubation with the plant extracts. Results: We show that the biological effect depended on both the concentration and the extraction solvent used. Heptane extracts, distinct from those in ethanol and ethyl acetate, were toxic to 10.014 pRSV-T cells at low concentrations (25 μg/mL) and did not demonstrate free radical scavenging effects. All tested extracts decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) and also anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression by human corneal cells when the extracts were added to the cell culture medium for 24 h. Conclusion: In conclusion, we show that the promising effects of the application of E. officinalis L. preparations as a supplementary therapy for eye disorders are associated with the ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts, not the heptane extract.",

However, no study has been conducted to explore the C1858T polymorphism in T2DM and HT coexistent cases up to now. Aims: The study aimed to determine whether a relationship exists or not between the PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism and this coexistent patient group. Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: Peripheral blood samples from 135 T2DM patients, 102 patients with coexistent T2DM+HT, 71 HT patients and 135 healthy controls were collected into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulant tubes and genomic DNA was extracted. The PTPN22 C1858T polymorphism was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods. Results: Statistically significant differences were not observed between the patient and control groups. This study demonstrated a statistically significant association between both the CT genotype and the T allele in the female patient group with coexistent T2DM+HT (CT genotype: p=0.04; T allele: p=0.045) with a statistically significant association between the CT genotype and the mean values of body mass index (BMI) and free T3 levels (FT3) (BMI: p=0.044 and FT3: p=0.021) that was detected in the patient group with coexistent T2DM+HT. The minor genotype TT was observed in none of the groups in this study. The CT genotype frequency was [number (frequency): 5 (3.8%), 7 (6.86%), 5 (7.04%), 3 (2.22%), while the T allele frequency was 5 (1.86%), 7 (3.44%), 5 (3.53%) and 3 (1.12%)] in the T2DM, T2DM+HT, HT and control groups, respectively. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the PTPN22 1858T allele and the CT genotype are associated with increased risk in female patients for coexistent T2DM+HT. The CT genotype was associated with high mean BMI and free T3 values in the patient group with coexistent T2DM+HT. These results demonstrate that T allele carriers were more often in the T2DM+HT group than in the T2DM group. Therefore, the combination of T2DM and HT with female gender may have higher T allele carriage in comparison to the T2DM only and male groups.",

Fifteen (48.4%) cases were associated with cardiac defects and 17 (54.8%) cases had associated extracardiac sonographic or postpartum findings. Two fetuses had karyotype anomalies. Outcome was significantly more favorable in cases not associated with cardiac defects in comparison to those associated with cardiac anomalies (84.6% vs. 33.3%, p=0.009). All cases with isolated PLSVC survived, while among the cases associated with extracardiac anomalies, with cardiac anomalies and with both extracardiac and cardiac anomalies, the survival rate was 75%, 50% and 22.2%, respectively. The most frequent group of cardiac anomalies associated with PLSVC was septal defects and VSD was the most common heart defect individually, being observed in nine fetuses. Conclusion: Prenatally diagnosed PLSVC is associated with cardiac and extracardiac anomalies in the majority of cases. Outcome is significantly worse if PLSVC is associated with a cardiac defect, and the prognosis is excellent in isolated cases.",

Aims: The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between the ITGA2 C807T and ITGB3 T176C polymorphic loci with ischemic stroke, as well as plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. Study Design: Case control study. Methods: Human venous blood samples were collected from patients admitted for ischemic stroke (n=350, ‘patients’) and healthy individuals (n=300, ‘controls’). Blood was genotyped at these loci by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels were measured by routine enzymatic, masking, and turbidimetry methods. Results: As expected, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein were all significantly higher in patients than in controls (p<0.05). Genotype and allele frequencies of ITGA2 C807T were significantly different between patients and controls (p<0.05), but no difference was detected in genotype or allele frequencies for ITGA3 T176C. For ITGA-2, the T allele conferred a 1.226 times higher relative risk of ischemic stroke than the C allele (odds ratio=1.226, 95% confidence interval=1.053–1.428). Similarly, total cholesterol was higher in T allele carriers than in non-carriers (p<0.05). Conclusion: ITGA2 C807T polymorphism is associated with ischemic stroke, with the T allele acting as a susceptibility allele that appears to confer increased cholesterol levels.",

Study Design: Retrospective comparative study. Methods: During the period from 2006 to , cochlear implantation was performed on 26 children. Eighteen of these children had undergone genetic tests for mutation of the Gap Junction Protein Beta 2 (GJB2) gene. Bi-allelic GJB2 mutations were confirmed in 7 out of 18 examined children. In order to confirm whether genetic factors have influence on speech perception after cochlear implantation, we compared the post-implantation speech performance of seven children with mutations of the GBJ2 (connexin 26) gene with seven other children who had the wild type version of this particular gene. The latter were carefully matched according to the age at cochlear implantation. Speech perception performance was measured before cochlear implantation, and one and two years after implantation. All the patients were arranged in line with the appropriate speech perception category (SPC). Non-parametric tests, Friedman ANOVA and Mann-Whitney’s U test were used for statistical analysis. Results: Both groups showed similar improvements in speech perception scores after cochlear implantation. Statistical analysis did not confirm significant differences between the groups 12 and 24 months after cochlear implantation.

Aims: This study aimed to investigate the cause of RDS in full-term neonates by a retrospective case-control study. Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: Among the patients admitted to Bayi Children’s Hospital between January 2008 and December 2010, a total of 205 full-term neonates with RDS were assigned to the study group, and 410 full-term neonates without RDS were assigned to the control group.

Results: The results of logistic regression analysis showed that the following causes were closely correlated with term neonatal RDS: selective cesarean section (OR: 8.737; 95% CI: 5.232-14.588), severe birth asphyxia (OR: 6.988; 95% CI: 2.990-16.333), small gestational age (OR: 6.222; 95% CI: 2.001-8.993), maternal-fetal infection (OR: 5.337; 95% CI: 1.999-8.233), PROM (OR: 3.380; 95% CI: 1.986-5.754), male sex (OR: 2.641; 95% CI: 1.721-4.053), gestational glucose intolerance or diabetes (OR: 2.415; 95% CI:1.721-4.053), and low birth weight (OR: 2.323; 95% CI: 1.329-4.060). Conclusion: Several high-risk factors, such as selective cesarean section, severe birth asphyxia, maternal-fetal infection, PROM, and male sex are closely correlated with full-term neonatal RDS. These could provide a significant reference for the diagnosis and treatment of term neonatal RDS. Total Times Cited: 16 (Updated on May. 10 2020 - WoS)",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common acquired disorder seen in chronic renal failure. It may result in potentially serious complications including metabolic bone diseases, severe atherosclerosis and undesirable cardiovascular events. Parathyroidectomy is required in about 20% of patients after 3-10 years of dialysis and in up to 40% after 20 years. Aims: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism who had undergone total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation and thymectomy or subtotal parathyroidectomy with thymectomy by the same surgical team during the study period. Study Design: Retrospective comparative study. Methods: Clinical data of 50 patients who underwent parathyroid surgery for secondary hyperparathyroidism between 2003 and 2011 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were divided into two subgroups of total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation or subtotal parathyroidectomy. Thymectomy was routinely performed for both groups. Short term outcome parameters included intact parathyroid hormone, ionized calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels. Bone pain, bone fractures, persistent or recurrent disease were included in long term outcome parameters. Results: The mean duration of dialysis was eight years. The mean ionized calcium levels dropped significantly in the total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation group (p=0.016). No serious postoperative complications were observed. Postoperative intravenous calcium supplementation was required in four patients in the total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation group (total PTX+AT) and in three patients in the subtotal parathyroidectomy group (subtotal PTX). Postoperatively, all patients received oral calcium carbonate and calcitriol. The length of average hospital stay was 5 (3-10) days. Including nine patients who underwent successful renal transplantation pre-operative bone symptoms, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and an increased alkaline phosphatase levels were improved or resolved in all patients. After a mean follow-up of 65 months, three patients (6%) had persistent and one (2%) had recurrent disease. Conclusion: Total parathroidectomy with autotransplantation is a beneficial and safe surgical procedure for patients on chronic dialysis with otherwise uncontrollable secondary hyperparathroidism and even in patients who have undergone renal transplantation after parathyroidectomy. Careful cervical exploration and routine thymectomy should be considered as a routine part of the surgical approach regardless of the preferred technique.

Study Design: Animal experimentation. Methods: The rat MMECs were cultivated, and H/R model was made to imitate ischemia-reperfusion injury. The cells were seeds in 96-wellplates (100μL/hole) or in 6cm diameter dishes (2 mL/dish) with the density of 1×106/mL and randomly divided into 4 groups (n=6 each): control group (Group N), hypoxia-regoxygen group (Group H/R), Diazoxide preconditioning+H/R group (Group DZ) and Diazoxide preconditioning +mitochondrial KATP blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) + H/R group (Group DZ+5-HD). The cells were exposed to 2h hypoxia followed by 2h reoxygenation. Diazoxide 100μmol/L and diazoxide 100μmol/L+ 5-HD100μmol/L were added to the culture medium 2h before hypoxia in DZ and DZ+5-HD groups respectively. Each group was observed the proliferation in MTT, apoptotic rate in Annexin V-FITC/PI double standard, cell structure of Hoechst staining, and the levels of PI3K, Akt and p53 mRNA by RT-qPCR. Results: Compared with Group N, apoptotic rate of Group H/R increased (p<0.01) and the vitality decreased significantly (p<0.05), and the expression of PI3K, Akt and p53 mRNA elevated in Group H/R (p<0.05). Compared with Group H/R, apoptotic rate and p53 mRNA level of Group DZ depressed significantly (p<0.01, p<0.05), while the vitality, PI3K and Akt mRNA levels increased (p<0.05). Compared with Group DZ, apoptotic rate and p53 mRNA level of Group DZ+5-HD increased significantly (p<0.01, p<0.05), but the vitality, PI3K and Akt mRNA levels decreased (p<0.05). Conclusion: Under the condition of H/R, mito-KATP opened by DZ may depend on PI3K/Akt pathway to regulate expression level of the downstream p53 mRNA to inhibit apoptosis and improve viability of MMECs at the same time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Intrauterine perfusion insufficiency induced by transient maternal hypotension has been reported to be associated with foetal brain malformations. However, the effects of maternal hypotension on apoptotic processes in the foetal brain have not been investigated experimentally during the intrauterine period. Aims: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of transient maternal hypotension on apoptotic cell death in the intrauterine foetal brain. Study Design: Animal experimentation. Methods: Three-month-old female Wistar albino rats were allocated into four groups (n=5 each). The impact of hypoxic/ischemic injury induced by transient maternal hypotension on the 15th day of pregnancy (late gestation) in rats was investigated at 48 (H17 group) or 96 hours (H19 group) after the insult. Control groups underwent the same procedure except for induction of hypotension (C17 and H17 groups). Brain sections of one randomly selected foetus from each pregnant rat were histopathologically evaluated for hypoxic/ischemic injury in the metencephalon, diencephalon, and telencephalon by terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling and active cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease-3 (caspase-3) positivity for cell death. Results: The number of terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (+) cells in all the areas examined was comparable in both hypotension and control groups. The H17 group had active caspase-3 (+) cells in the metencephalon and telencephalon, sparing diencephalon, whereas the C19 and H19 groups had active caspase-3 (+) cells in all three regions. The number of active caspase-3 (+) cells in the telencephalon in the H19 group was higher compared with the metencephalon and diencephalon and compared with H17 group (p<0.05). Conclusion: Our results suggest that prenatal hypoxic/ischemic injury triggers apoptotic mechanisms. Therefore, blockade of apoptotic pathways, considering the time pattern of the insult, may constitute a potential neuroprotective approach for the detrimental effects of prenatal hypoperfusion.

Laparotomy revealed a cystic mass in the pouch of Douglas, originating from the left sacrouterine ligament. A total excision of the tumour was performed and showed low-grade adenosarcoma without sarcomatous overgrowth. Follow-up at 24 months after the surgery showed no evidence of recurrence. Conclusion: Mullerian adenosarcoma located in the pouch of Douglas is rare. For treatment, success may be achieved with only excision of the tumour if there is no sarcomatous overgrowth or spread to adjacent tissues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone was first described in 1957 by Schwartz, and is characterised by hyponatraemia, inappropriately increased urine osmolality and urine sodium, and decreased serum osmolality in a euvolemic patient without edema. A patient with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone should have normal cardiac, renal, adrenal, hepatic, and thyroid functions and should not take any diuretics. Case Report: We present a case of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone caused by codeine and associated with reduced urine volume, increased urine sodium, and decreased serum sodium concentration. Conclusion: The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone is a disease that can lead to morbidity and even mortality.
