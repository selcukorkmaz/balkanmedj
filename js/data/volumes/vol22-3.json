    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Hemiparesis is the most frequent neurological problem after stroke. The immobilization resulting from motor weakness in hemiparetic patients has adverse effects on bone tissue. In this study, the relationship between functional disability and bone mass was investigated. Patients and Methods: Forty-one left hemiparetic patients (13 women, 28 men; mean age 59.5±14.2 years; range 16 to 78 years) who were hospitalized for the first time after stroke for rehabilitation were recruited. Motor recovery was evaluated according to the Brunnstrom stages (BR), and spasticity was assessed according to the modified Ashworth index. Activities of daily living and functional disability were evaluated by the Barthel Index (BI). Bone mineral content (BMC) was measured by dual X- ray absorptiometry in the forearm and femur on both nonparetic and paretic sides. Results: On the paretic side, BMC values of both the forearm and femur were significantly lower (p<0.05). Bone mineral content showed a positive correlation with BR scores and BI (p<0.05). We did not find any significant association between BMC values and the Ashworth index (p>0.05). The neuromotor improvement and independency level of the patient were found to be in relationship with the bone mass. Conclusion: Loss of BMC due to hemiparesis may be prevented with an effective treatment resulting in functional improvement. This may be helpful in protecting the patient from secondary complications of low bone density.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: We investigated the morphologic changes showing hepatocellular damage caused by the chronic use of cisplatin, an antineoplastic agent, and the protective effect of vitamins E and C. Study Design: Twenty-four Wistar albino male rats were randomly assigned to four groups, equal in number, to receive intravenous 5 mg/kg of cisplatin once a month for three months except for the control rats (group 1). The rats in group 3 and 4 also received daily intramuscular injections of 5 mg/kg of vitamin E and 8 mg/kg of vitamin C, respectively. At the end of three months, the livers were removed for light and electron microscopic examinations. Results: Control rats showed a normal liver tissue structure. Group 2 rats exhibited disorganization of the Remak's fibers, thickening of the basement membrane together with dilatation of the sinusoids near the centrolobular vein, and lymphocyte infiltration in the portal areas. In vitamin E-treated rats, there was a significant decrease in morphological damage, with disappearance of lymphocyte infiltration in the portal areas. Vitamin C-treated rats manifested the least morphological damage, with a rare infiltration to portal areas and decreased number of infiltration cells. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the use of antioxidants of different properties may help reduce cisplatin hepatotoxicity, thus contributing to clinical applications.",
