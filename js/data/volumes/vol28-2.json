Material and Methods: In this study, 130 MRSA and 20 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were tested among various clinical samples between February 2006 and June 2008. Confi rmation of S. aureus isolates and the methicillin resistance of these isolates were made by multiplex PCR. The presence of PVL was tested by both multiplex PCR and single target PCR. Results: The presence of PVL was determined in 3 isolates. Two of the isolates were from MRSA isolates, one was from MSSA isolates. One of the PVL positive MRSA isolate was recovered from a wound specimen, the other was from blood culture. PVL positive MSSA isolate was recovered from an urine specimen. All of the three PVL positive isolates were resistant to tetracycline. One of the PVL positive MRSA isolates which was recovered from blood culture was resistant to gentamicin and ciprofl oxacin, while the other PVL positive isolate was susceptible. Conclusion: Further studies are needed to determine the prevalence and genetic characteristics of PVL positive isolates and to prevent dissemination of PVL positive isolates both in the hospital environment and the community.",

Material and Methods: A total of 40 healthy volunteers (mean age: 39±12 years, all female) were examined. Hand strength was assessed by the Jamar hand dynamometer. IM and IMFP thickness and width for both hands (n:80) were measured sonographically at four levels (1th, 2nd, 3rd and 4th intermetacarpal; palmar side for IM) and at three levels (2nd, 3rd and 4th intermetacarpal; dorsal side for IMFP). Results: The mean grip strength was 40±12 pounds (range: 20-67). Mean values (thickness x width) for IM were 20.7±2.1×9.9±1.2 mm, 9.0±1×10.3±0.9 mm, 7.3±1.0×9.9±1.0 mm, 8.5±1×9.5±0.9 mm at four levels, respectively. Mean values (thickness x width) for IMFP were 9.9±1.2×5.3±0.7 mm, 8.5±0.9×5.4±0.7 mm and 9.0±1.2×4.7±0.7 mm at three levels, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the grip strength and the dimensions of IM and IMFP (p<0.05). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the correlation of grip strength and the sonographic IM-IMFP measurements. Further research in study groups affected by clinical situations involving the hand, is necessary to reveal the role of IM and IMFP studies in evaluating the pathologies.",

FDG-PET results were compared with those of CT and correlated with histopathologic findings or with clinical course. Results: FDG-PET had a sensitivity of 96% and positive predictive value of 100% for the diagnosis of primary cancer, while CT had values of 68% and 95%, respectively. FDG-PET was superior to CT in detecting additional metastatic disease with a sensitivity of 89%, while CT had 33%.

Results: FDG-PET had a sensitivity of 96% and positive predictive value of 100% for the diagnosis of primary cancer, while CT had values of 68% and 95%, respectively. FDG-PET was superior to CT in detecting additional metastatic disease with a sensitivity of 89%, while CT had 33%. FDG-PET resulted in altered management for 8 patients of whom three avoided inappropriate surgery. Conclusion: It is concluded that FDG-PET is highly sensitive for the diagnosis and staging of patients with CRC. Its use in conjunction with CT results in a more accurate selection of patients for surgical treatment with curative intent.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: Patients with locally advanced breast cancer may undergo breast conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The aim of the study is to evaluate the results of locally advanced breast cancer patients who underwent breast conserving surgery, axillary dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy in a single center. Material and Methods: 12 patients with locally advanced breast cancer stage IIIA/IIIB were included in the study between 2002-2009. The patients were given anthracycline-based regimen before surgery. Patients underwent breast conserving surgery, axillary dissection, and sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by radiotherapy. Results: There were five patients in stage IIIA, six in stage IIIB, and one in stage IIIC. Patients had received 3-6 regimen of FAC/FEC. Eight had partial and four had complete response. Five positive axilla were detected. The median value of the lymph nodes was 12 (n:8-19). Five patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. The biopsy has failed in one patient and the median value of dissected sentinel node was 3.5 (n:3-4). Locoregional recurrence was not observed in any patients. The mean follow-up of the patients was 29.8 months and median time was 16 (n:2-80) months. Of the 12 patients 10 are alive and 2 were deceased. Conclusion: In selected locally advanced patients, breast conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy may be applied by a multidisciplinary approach, and excellent success may be achieved in those patients as in early breast cancer patients.",

The Mallampati test, Wilson score, Cormack-Lehane test and thyromental distance are the most commonly used tests pre-operatively to assess the airway. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether a combination of the Mallampati and Cormack-Lehane's classification to predict difficult intubation compared with sternomental and thyromental distances, mandibular length, width and neck length and circumference. Material and Methods: Two hundred twenty seven cases between 17 and 70 years old undergoing elective surgery were included in the study. Age, gender, body weight, body height and BMI were noted preoperatively. The pharyngeal structures were examined before the operation. At the time of intubation, laryngoscopic evaluation was performed according to the Cormack-Lehane's laryngoscopic classification. Results: For analysis, Mallampati and Cormack-Lehane's laryngoscopic classification were grouped as difficult (grades III and IV) or easy (grades I and II). Whereas Mallampati scoring were class 1 and 2 (easy) in 72.7% cases, Cormack-Lehane's laryngoscopic scoring 90.7% of the cases were in class 1 and 2. The combination of the Cormeck-Lehane classification with neck circumference had the highest sensitivity (94.74%), but this combination decreased the positive predictive value. The combination of the Mallampati classification with neck length had the highest sensitivity (67.86%), but this combination decreased the positive predictive value. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the Mallampati and Cormeck-Lehane classification by itself is insufficient for predicting difficult intubation so should be used in conjunction with measurement of neck circumference and Cormeck-lehane test. Mallampati test with sternomental and thyromental distances in addition with neck length may be useful in routine test for preoperative prediction of difficult intubation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective: In this in vitro study, we investigated the vasoactive effects of levobupivacaine and ropivacaine on vascular smooth muscle derived from human umbilical arteries and veins. Material and Methods: The strips were mounted in tissue baths at 37°C continuously gassed with 5% CO2 in oxygen for isometric recording of contractile activity on a polygraph. The endothelium of some tissues was mechanically removed to assess the influence of the endothelium on contractility. The strips were precontracted with serotonin (10-6 M 5-HT; n=7). After obtaining the maximal contraction, responses obtained by adding levobupivacaine and ropivacaine (10-9-10-4 M; n=7) cumulatively were recorded. Contractions were expressed as the (% of 5HT maximal response) percentage of 5 HT's maximal response. Results: Both levobupivacaine and ropivacaine induce a concentrationdependent contraction in the smooth muscle cells of umbilical arteries and veins. Maximum contractile response (Emax) of levobupivacaine (79.2±2.5, 71.1±2.6) was higher than ropivacaine (68.4±2, 36.2±2.8) on both umbilical arteries and veins. There were no statistically significant differences between contraction responses of endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded tissues.

Material and Methods: We included 20 osteoarthritis patients and 20 healthy controls. Protein C activity and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels in plasma and synovia were evaluated by ELISA technique. Results: In the patient group, protein C activities decreased and TNF-α levels increased significantly both in synovia and plasma when compared with the controls. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate of the patient group was found to be significantly elevated in comparison to the controls. On the other hand, serum C reactive protein values increased insignificantly when compared to controls.

Ketamine were given to these groups in the following manner respectively; 1mg/kg intravenous ketamine before incision (preincisional); the same dose ketamine 10 minutes following the first incision (intraoperative); and ketamine at the end of the surgical operation (postoperative). The pain of patients was assessed by postoperative pain scale (CHIPPS) in children and infants; the sedation status of children was assessed by Ramsey's sedation scale. The first analgesic requirement time was recorded. Results: No significant difference was found in demographic characteristics of the three groups (p>0.05). Lower CHIPPS scores were found in Group Post throughout all measurement periods (p<0.05). Group Post was found to have significantly higher sedation levels compared with the other two groups (p=0.003).

Materials and Methods: Fifty children between the 7 and 11 years old (10 from each age group) participated in this study. The measurements were made with Zebris© CMS 70 P 3D motion analysis system. Flexion- extension, abduction-adduction angles of the hip joint, the flexion-extension of the knee and ankle joints and foot rotations for each age group for both sides were recorded. Results: Even all the groups' gait patterns were similar with the literature, 9 years old group has lower knee flexion and higher ankle extensions (p<0.05). Eight and 9 years old groups have higher maximum ankle extension values when compared with the other age groups (p<0.05). Conclusion: Kinematic analysis results of 7 to 11 years old children suggests adult-like gait patterns especially for the hip and knee. These findings stress the importance of age-matched normative data for the kinematic gait analysis.",

These infections have been reported in patients who had received vancomycin to treat their underlying diseases. Nosocomial meningitis caused by Leuconostoc spp. was diagnosed in our patient.

We describe a 14-year-old boy who presented with fever, abdominal pain and severe myalgia in all his muscles for 5 days. The diagnosis of PFM was considered based on the presence of fever, paralyzing myalgia with normal CPK, elevated CRP and ESR. Thus, we started prednisolone treatment and his symptoms disappeared and acute-phase reactants declined rapidly. Mutational analysis of the MEFV gene demonstrated homozygote M694V mutation. Thus, he was diagnosed as PFM and FMF. In this report, we present a child with PFM as the sole feature preceding the diagnosis of FMF, and draw attention to the PFM for the diagnosis of FMF even the patient does not fulfill the criteria for the clinical diagnosis.",
