Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is a condition that leads to anatomical and functional losses due to accumulation of degraded abnormal fibrillar material in the intraocular and extraocular tissues. Histopathological studies have shown that the accumulation of Pseudoexfoliation syndrome material in the vascular structures may play a role in different ocular pathologies such as retinal vein occlusion, iris hypoperfusion, anterior segment hypoxia, retinal arterial occlusion, and neovascular glaucoma.Aims: To evaluate and compare flow and vascular density in the retina and choroid in eyes with Pseudoexfoliation syndrome, fellow eyes without Pseudoexfoliation syndrome, and healthy eyes using optical coherence tomography angiography.Study Design: Case control study.Methods: The study included 35 eyes with Pseudoexfoliation syndrome of 35 Pseudoexfoliation syndrome patients, 32 fellow eyes without Pseudoexfoliation syndrome of 32 unilateral Pseudoexfoliation syndrome patients, and 35 eyes of healthy control subjects. Flow area and vascular density in the superficial capillary plexus and deep capillary plexus were measured by optical coherence tomography angiography as three separate parameters: total, parafoveal, and foveal. Choroidal thickness and foveal avascular zone area were measured for each patient.Results: There were significant differences between the Pseudoexfoliation syndrome eyes and control eyes in total, parafoveal, and foveal flow and vascular density in the superficial capillary plexus (p<0.05 for all), while there were no significant differences between these groups in any of the flow or vascular density values in the deep capillary plexus (p>0.05).

It may be related to iatrogenic, neurologic, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, or metabolic disorders. Moreover, it could also be seen in the course of an ischemic stroke.Aims: To determine whether pathological yawning is a prognostic marker of middle cerebral artery stroke and evaluate its relationship with the infarct location.Study Design: Cross-sectional study.Methods: We examined 161 patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke, consecutively admitted to emergency department. Demographic information, stroke risk factors, stroke type according to Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment classification, blood oxygen saturation, body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, glucose levels, daytime of stroke onset, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, at admission and 24 h), modified Rankin scale (at 3 months), and infarct locations were documented. Pathological yawning was defined as ≥3 yawns/15 min. All patients were observed for 6 hours to detect pathological yawning. National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score >10 was determined as severe stroke. The correlation between the presence of pathological yawning and stroke severity, infarct location, and the short- and long-term outcomes of the patients were evaluated.Results: Sixty-nine (42.9%) patients had pathological yawning and 112 (69.6%) had cortical infarcts. Insular and opercular infarcts were detected in 65 (40.4%) and 54 (33.5%) patients, respectively. Pathological yawning was more frequently observed in patients with cortical, insular, and opercular infarcts (p<0.05). Pathological yawning was related to higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores. Patients with severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥10) presented with more pathological yawning than those with mild to moderate strokes (p<0.05). The clinical outcomes and mortality rates showed no significant relationship with the occurrence of pathological yawning.Conclusion: Pathological yawning in middle cerebral artery stroke was associated with stroke severity, presence of cortical involvement, and insular and opercular infarcts. However, no association was found with long-term outcome and mortality.",

We used the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory questionnaire; the physical health and psychosocial health scores were calculated using the responses of the sibling and parent.

The physical health, psychosocial health, and total health scores of healthy siblings of children with chronic disease were significantly lower than that of healthy siblings of healthy children (p<0.001).

    "abstract": "Abstract Aims: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by telangiectasia, epistaxis, and vascular malformations. Pathogenic mutations were found in ENG, AVCRL1, SMAD4, and GDF genes. In this study, we present our database of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia regarding the phenotype-genotype relations and discuss two novel ENG gene pathogenic variations in two unrelated families.Methods: Next Generation Sequencing analysis was performed on the peripheral blood of nine patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in four unrelated families. All patients were diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia according to the Curaçao criteria. Data on treatment and screenings of visceral involvement were recorded from files.Results: We have found a pathogenic variation in either the ENG or ACVRL1 gene in each family. Two novel pathogenic variations in the ENG gene, including NM_000118.3 (ENG): c.416delC (p.P139fs*24) and NM_000118.3(ENG): c.1139dupT (p.Leu380PhefsTer16), were found in the same family. The NM_000020.2(ACVRL1): c.1298C>T (p.Pro433Leu) pathogenic variation in the ACVRL1 gene in our first family and a novel heterozygous likely pathogenic NM_000020.2(ACVRL1): c.95T>C (p.Val32Ala) variation was found in our second family. Seven of the nine patients were treated with thalidomide for controlling bleeding episodes. All patients responded to thalidomide. In one patient, the response to thalidomide was lost and switched to bevacizumab.Conclusion: In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, certain types of mutations correlate with disease phenotypes and with next generation sequencing methods. New pathogenic variations can be revealed, which might help manage patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Aims: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by telangiectasia, epistaxis, and vascular malformations. Pathogenic mutations were found in ENG, AVCRL1, SMAD4, and GDF genes. In this study, we present our database of patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia regarding the phenotype-genotype relations and discuss two novel ENG gene pathogenic variations in two unrelated families.Methods: Next Generation Sequencing analysis was performed on the peripheral blood of nine patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in four unrelated families. All patients were diagnosed with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia according to the Curaçao criteria. Data on treatment and screenings of visceral involvement were recorded from files.Results: We have found a pathogenic variation in either the ENG or ACVRL1 gene in each family. Two novel pathogenic variations in the ENG gene, including NM_000118.3 (ENG): c.416delC (p.P139fs*24) and NM_000118.3(ENG): c.1139dupT (p.Leu380PhefsTer16), were found in the same family.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Recurrence of tracheoesophageal fistula is a frequent complication after esophageal atresia repair. Acquired tracheoesophageal fistulas are long new fistulas that are localized at sites that are not typical of the congenital tracheoesophageal fistula. We present four cases to discuss the diagnostic and management challenges concerning various acquired tracheoesophageal fistula localizations.Case Report: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of patients admitted with acquired tracheoesophageal fistula in the last 5 years. Among the 16 postoperative tracheoesophageal fistulas, 4 were classified as acquired tracheoesophageal fistula. Patients’ admission age ranged from 1 to 8 years. The female to male ratio was 2:2. The presented cases were admitted with recurrent respiratory tract infections, choking, and coughing. The acquired tracheoesophageal fistulas were observed between the esophagus and cervical trachea, between the esophagus and the right bronchus passing through intrathoracic abscess cavity, in the right bronchus, and between the colon conduit and trachea. One of the acquired tracheoesophageal fistulas healed spontaneously, whereas others required surgical ligation.Conclusion: Acquired tracheoesophageal fistula most often occurs secondary to local or diffuse mediastinitis. Acquired tracheoesophageal fistula may appear at unusual sites not typical of congenital tracheoesophageal fistula, such as esophagus-to-right bronchus and conduit to trachea. Therefore, the unusual locations of acquired tracheoesophageal fistula should be borne in mind, and patients evaluated and managed more comprehensively.",
