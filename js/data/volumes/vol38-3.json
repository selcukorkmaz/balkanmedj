Limitations of this block include tourniquet discomfort, short duration of anesthesia, and absence of postoperative analgesia. Dexmedetomidine has been used as an adjuvant to minimize these negative characteristics with inconclusive results.Aim: To perform a systematic review of the existing evidence on the role of dexmedetomidine as an additive to intravenous regional anesthesia in upper limb surgery.Study Design: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.Methods: The databases searched were MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases, and clinicaltrials. gov (1990-2019). Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. We analyzed the duration of analgesia, onset time of sensory and motor block, intraoperative tourniquet pain scores, the incidence of tourniquet pain, need for rescue analgesia, intraoperative rescue analgesia consumption, sedation scores, postoperative pain scores, and anesthesia quality.Results: Intraoperative analgesia duration (MD 11.08 min; 95% CI 5.42, 16.75; P < .0001) was longer and sensory block onset time (MD −2.10 min; 95% CI −3.345, −0.86; P = .00009) was shorter in the dexmedetomidine group. Anesthesia quality scores (MD 0.58; 95% CI 0.47, 0.70; P < .00001) and postoperative sedation scores (MD 1.03; 95% CI 0.88, 1.24; P < .00001) were significantly higher. There was a significant reduction in intraoperative rescue analgesia consumption (MD −19.70 mg; 95% CI −24.15, −15.26; P < .00001) in the dexmedetomidine group. The risk of tourniquet pain as well as postoperative pain scores were lower in favor of dexmedetomidine. The addition of dexmedetomidine to IVRA slightly increased the risk of sedation.

    "abstract": "Background: Nicotine addiction is associated with nicotine absorption from the buccal mucosa, and it is stated that the main factor that determines nicotine absorption is saliva pH. In the literature, the effects of changes in saliva pH values after eating and drinking on smoking desire in smokers were not questioned.Aim: To show the effect of saliva pH changes on smoking desire. The secondary aim was to show the impact of coffee and water drinking on saliva pH and smoking on oral-dental health (oral hygiene and gingival bleeding).Study Design: Case–control study.Methods: A questionnaire was administered that included “Sociodemographic Data Form” and smoking history and Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Oral and dental examinations were performed with mirror sonds and using oral hygiene standard Silness and Leöe plaque index and DMFT Index (Index of Decayed Missing or Filled Teeth). Untreated saliva samples were taken, and baseline saliva flow rate and pH values were measured. To assess pH changes, saliva pH was remeasured after sugar-free instant coffee and water consumption. Smoking desire was evaluated with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).Results: In this study, 24 (55.8%) females and 19 (44.2%) males were among the 43 smoking and 39 nonsmoking cases. Smoking was significantly associated with poor oral hygiene (in smokers 4.71 (±1.40), in non-smokers 2.30 (±1.59); P < .01). DMFT index was higher in smokers than in non-smokers (in smokers 6.45 (±3.69), in non-smokers 3.87 (±2.67); P < .01). Gingival bleeding was more prevalent in smokers (0.68 (±0.76)) than non-smokers (1.20 (±0.90); P = .009). Salivary flow rates were lower in smokers (in smokers 2.56 (±1.34), in non-smokers 3.00 (±1.22), P = .06). In both groups, pH values increased after coffee consumption and decreased after water; in smokers basal: 6.67 (±0.41), pH coffee: 6.93 (±0.36), pH water: 6.85 (±0.33); in non-smokers pH basal: 6.84 (±0.37), pH coffee: 7.02 (±0.37), pH water: 6.97 (±0.31), P < .01.
