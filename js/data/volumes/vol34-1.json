    "abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT) is a curative treatment option for both malignant and some benign hematological diseases. During the last decade, many of the newer high-dose regimens in different intensity have been developed specifically for patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Today there are three main approaches used prior to allogeneic transplantation: Myeloablative (MA), Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) and Non-MA (NMA) regimens. MA regimens cause irreversible cytopenia and there is a requirement for stem cell support. Patients who receive NMA regimen have minimal cytopenia and this type of regimen can be given without stem cell support. RIC regimens do not fit the criteria of MA and NMA: the cytopenia is reversible and the stem cell support is necessary. NMA/RIC for Allo-HSCT has opened a new era for treating elderly patients and those with comorbidities. The RIC conditioning was used for 40% of all Allo-HSCT and this trend continue to increase. In this paper, we will review these regimens in the setting of especially allogeneic HSCT and our aim is to describe the history, features and impact of these conditioning regimens on specific diseases.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Intraabdominal adhesions remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Moreover, intraabdominal adhesions can develop in more than 50% of abdominal operations. Aims: We compared the anti-adhesive effects of two different agents on postoperative adhesion formation in a cecal abrasion model. Study Design: Experimental animal study. Methods: Forty Wistar albino type female rats were anesthetized and underwent laparotomy. Study groups comprised Sham, Control, Mitomycin-C, 4% Icodextrin, and Mitomycin-C +4% Icodextrin groups. Macroscopic and histopathological evaluations of adhesions were performed. Results: The frequencies of moderate and severe adhesions were significantly higher in the control group than the other groups. The mitomycin-C and Mitomycin-C +4% Icodextrin groups were associated with significantly lower adhesion scores compared to the control group and 4% Icodextrin group scores (p=0.002 and p=0.008, respectively). The adhesion scores of the Mitomycin-C group were also significantly lower than those of the 4% Icodextrin group (p=0.008). Conclusion: Despite its potential for bone marrow toxicity, Mitomycin-C seems to effectively prevent adhesions. Further studies that prove an acceptable safety profile relating to this promising anti-adhesive agent are required before moving into clinical trials. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Oxidative stress has been shown to play a principal role in the pathogenesis of stress-induced gastric injury. Parsley (Petroselinum crispum) contains many antioxidants such as flavanoids, carotenoids and ascorbic acid. Aims: In this study, the histopathological and biochemical results of nutrition with a parsley-rich diet in terms of eliminating stress-induced oxidative gastric injury were evaluated. Study Design: Animal experimentation. Methods: Forty male Wistar albino rats were divided into five groups: control, stress, stress + standard diet, stress + parsley-added diet and stress + lansoprazole (LPZ) groups. Subjects were exposed to 72 hours of fasting and later immobilized and exposed to the cold at +4 degrees for 8 hours to create a severe stress condition. Samples from the animals’ stomachs were arranged for microscopic and biochemical examinations. Results: Gastric mucosal injury was obvious in rats exposed to stress. The histopathologic damage score of the stress group (7.00±0.57) was higher than that of the control group (1.50±0.22) (p<0.05). Significant differences in histopathologic damage score were found between the stress and stress + parsley-added diet groups (p<0.05), the stress and stress + standard diet groups (p<0.05), and the stress and stress + LPZ groups (p<0.05). The mean tissue malondialdehyde levels of the stress + parsley-added group and the stress + LPZ group were lower than that of the stress group (p<0.05). Parsley supported the cellular antioxidant system by increasing the mean tissue glutathione level (53.31±9.50) and superoxide dismutase (15.18±1.05) and catalase (16.68±2.29) activities.

    "abstract": "Background: Tubal factor infertility is one of the main causes of female infertility. Although its sensitivity is low, hysterosalpingography (HSG) is remains the firstline method for evaluating tubal patency. Aims: To compare pregnancy rates in patients with HSG proven proximal or distal unilateral tubal occlusion,and unexplained infertility undergoing both controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) and intrauterine insemination(IUI). Study Design: Case control study. Methods: In total, 237 patients undergoing ovulation induction (OI) with gonadotropins and IUI were divided into two groups and evaluated. Study group consisted 59 patients with HSG proven unilateral tubal pathology, and 178 patients with unexplained infertility taken as control subjects. Cumulative pregnancy rate was the primary endpoint. Results: Cumulative pregnancy rates after three cycles of OI and IUI were 15.25% in study group and 20.79% in control group. Pregnancy rates between two groups were not statistically significant. Although, pregnancy rates in patients with proximal tubal occlusion (21.8%) were higher than in those with distal tubal occlusion (7.4%), the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Our study data shows that, regardless of the HCG proven occlusion area, COS and IUI might be a preferred treatment modality in patient with unilateral tubal occlusion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease, is very common in the Mediterranean basin and a major concern in livestock areas. We present a rare case of a Brucella-caused abscess in the neck of a stock-breeder in an endemic Greek area. Case Report: A 39-year-old male, living in the rural area of Thessaly, presented with a mass in the left area of his neck. Clinical examination and imaging tests revealed an abscess in the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. Sampling of the abscess by fine-needle aspiration yielded inflammatory fluid (17x103 cells/μL). Molecular sequencing (16S rRNA polymerase chain reaction) performed directly in the clinical sample identified the presence of Brucella melitensis within 24 hours after material sampling. The microorganism was isolated in agar media four days later. The Rose-Bengal test was negative, while the Brucellacapt test showed titer 1/320. Given the results obtained with these molecular techniques, the patient was offered treatment with streptomycin (1 g for 3 weeks) and oral doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 6 weeks), concurrently.

Olanzapine has been reported to induce priapism in several adult cases with schizophrenia and/or mood disorders but very rarely reported in children. Case Report: 9-year-old male with Asperger’s Syndrome (AS) referred to our clinic with the complaints of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. He was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and given methylphenidate treatment which ameliorated his ADHD symptoms. He started to have severe loss of appetite after methylphenidate treatment so olanzapine 2.5 mg/day was added to cope with severe inappetence. However he experienced priapism after olanzapine and priapism resolved after ceasing the drug. His mother restarted olanzapine because he benefited from olanzapine. But the same episodes occurred soon after olanzapine again and his mother had to stop the medication. Conclusion: Because atypical antipsychotics are now widely used in children, unusual side effects such as priapism should be taken into consideration for the differential diagnosis. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
