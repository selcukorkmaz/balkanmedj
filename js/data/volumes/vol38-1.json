    "abstract": "Background: Hirschsprung’s disease and sigmoid volvulus can sometimes be seen in the same patient.Aims: To investigate the presence of Hirschsprung's disease in patients with sigmoid volvulus and to discuss the diagnosis and treatment methods.Study Design: Systematic review.Methods: This systematic review has been reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and the methodological quality of systematic reviews guidelines. The PubMed and Scopus databases were scanned using the keywords “Hirschsprung* volvulus*” and “congenital aganglionic megacolon volvulus*”. The reference list of the selected studies was reviewed for cross-checking. Two reviewers independently screened the available literature. Only the Hirschsprung’s disease cases involving sigmoid volvulus were included, and cases of patients with volvulus in other sites was excluded. There was no restriction with respect to the publication language and type of writing. The primary outcome was morbidity and mortality.Results: A total of 31 cases were analyzed in 22 articles; 97% of the patients were under the age of 40, 90% were male. There was a statistically significant difference in the necessity for relaparotomy between patients who were scheduled for sigmoid volvulus therapy with the suspicion of Hirschsprung’s disease and patients who were treated without suspicion of Hirschsprung’s disease (0% vs 37.5%, p=0.02). While there was no postoperative death in cases with suspected Hirschsprung disease, this mortality rate was 25% in cases without suspicion (p = 0.08).Conclusion: Hirschsprung's disease should be excluded with rectal biopsy if a patient with sigmoid volvulus is under 40 years of age and has complaints of constipation from childhood.",

Circulating soluble lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 concentrations in female patients with multi-vessel, double-vessel, and single-vessel coronary artery disease had evidently elevated compared with that in male patients (p<0.001).

Screening of 73 ICU healthcare workers (HCWs) and screening of 13 patients was performed for outbreak investigation. Nine clinical isolates available in stocks and eight screening MRSA isolates were included in molecular studies. PFGE, spa-mecA-mecC-PVL in-house multiplex PCR assay and spa typing, SCCmec typing were performed for all isolates. Sequence type of the representative strain was determined by Multi-Locus Sequence typing (MLST).Results: All strains were mecA positive, PVL negative, and have the same antimicrobial susceptibility pattern except for two strains. All clinical, two patient screening and three nasal isolates of HCWs showed the same pulsotype, named clone A. The spa type of outbreak isolates is t030 and the SCCmec type is SCCmecIII; the MLST type of representative strain is ST239 (PFGE pulsotype A, ST239-SCCmecIII-t030). Unrelated three isolates had PFGE pulsotype B-SCCmecI-t030, PFGE pulsotype C-SCCmecIII-t459, PFGE pulsotype D-SCCmecIII.Conclusion: Molecular typing techniques are the cornerstones for the investigation of outbreaks. Infection control measures, such as enhancing cleaning procedures, promoting hand hygiene, should be enforced in the ICU unit. All patients, including those who have already been discharged to other departments, must be put on contact isolation. HCWs carrying the MRSA strains could be offered decolonization.",

Animals were caged in 4 groups randomly. First group was a control (n=3). Second group was vehicle control (n=3) and injected 150 μL of blank solution (50% dimethyl sulfoxide in saline /0.9% of NaCl). While for acute toxicity experiments, 5-MeO-MiPT was added to a blank solution in order to obtain a dose of 0.27 mg/kg in 150 μL injection (n=10) and the last group were injected 2.7 mg/kg 5-MeO-MiPT in a 150 μL injection (n=10). Quantitative toxicological analysis, hystotoxicological and immunohistochemical analysis were performed.Results: In the toxicological analysis, 5-MeO-MiPT was found negative in biological samples which were control, vehicle control, and 0.27 mg/kg dose mice groups. 5-MeO-MiPT was found 2.7-13.4 ng/mL in blood, 11-29 ng/g in kidney, 15.2-108.3 ng/g in liver, and 1.5-40.6 ng/g in the brain in 2,7 mg/kg injected group. In a low dose of the 5-MeO-MiPT liver section, compared with normal tissues, the difference in staining was statistically significant (p<0.0001).

Bioinformatics analysis predicted miR-19a-3p-associated biological function, pathway, core regulatory network, and target genes. Luciferase reporter assay verified the target sequence of miR-19a-3p regulating FBXO32.Results: miR-19a-3p is upregulated in multiple myeloma cells (p<0.01) and patients with multiple myeloma (p<0.001). Overexpressed miR-19a-3p significantly increased cell viability (p<0.05) and inhibited cell apoptosis (p<0.01). FBXO32 is a target gene of miR-19a-3p (p<0.01). Moreover, FBXO32 is downregulated in MM, and it significantly decreased cell viability (p<0.05) and promoted cell apoptosis (p<0.01).FBXO32 significantly rescued the influence of miR-19a-3p-inhibiting cell apoptosis (p<0.05).Conclusion: miR-19a-3p promoted cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis by degrading the target FBXO32 mRNA in multiple myeloma.",
