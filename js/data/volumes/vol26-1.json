    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) and AT1R (A1166C) gene polymorphisms in ischemic stroke patients in Trakya region and the relation between these gene polymorphisms and stroke subtypes and vascular risk factors. Patients and Methods: The study involved 162 patients with ischemic stroke and 146 control subjects. Ischemic stroke patients were divided into large and small vessel disease subgroups according to ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment TOAST criteria. The ACE I/D polymorphism was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the AT1R (A1166C) polymorphism was identified using PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay. Results: The ACE I/D genotype distribution in patients (DD=34.0%, ID=50.0%, II=16.0%) did not differ from those in controls (DD=34.3%, ID=49.7%, II=16.1%). The AT1R A1166C genotype distribution in patients (AA=58.0%, CA=34.6%, CC=7.4%) did not significantly differ from those in controls (AA=60.1%, CA=35.7%, CC=4.2%). There was also no difference among the stroke subgroups regarding the distribution of ACE I/D and AT1R (A1166C) polymorphisms. Conclusion: Our results show that ACE I/D and AT1R (A1166C) gene polymorphisms were not genetic risk factors for ischemic stroke in subjects in Trakya region.",

Additional biomarkers in severe sepsis are needed to tackle the challenges of determining a prognosis and optimizing the selection of high-risk patients for therapy.

Results: Amylase levels, median CRP levels, and APACHE II scores were significantly higher in the non-survivors than in the surviving patients.

Patients and Methods: The study comprised of 61 patients (38 girls, 28 boys; mean age 81.2±44.5 months; range 12 to 168 months) who received valproate because of epilepsy or prophylaxis of febrile seizures. All cases were evaluated in terms of bone mineral metabolism disturbances by assessing bone mineral density and biochemistry parameters, before and after 12 months of valproate therapy. Results: At the end of one year of valproate therapy, there were no statistically significant differences in calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase levels that might show bone mineralization disturbance. Osteoporosis was recorded in two cases (3.3%). Conclusion: The side effects of valproate on bone mineral metabolism are usually contradictory. In order to determine osteopenia signs; bone biochemistry, 25- OH vitamin D3, hormonal parameters and bone mineral density, which are not enough for evaluation alone, have to be evaluated together.

Patients and Methods: The study included 100 subjects (50 males, 50 females; range 18 to 22 years). The Zebris® 3D Motion Analysis System was used for the measurement. Lateral bending, flexion, extension, pelvic tilt were evaluated in the measurements. Results: The average value for total lateral flexion at lumbar spine was found to be 51.3°±7.5 in males and 52.7°±9.9 in females. Total flexion-extension was 81.0°±11.1 in males and 80.2°±10.2 in females. L4-L5 flexion, L5-S1 extension values were statistically high in women (p<0.05) while L3-L4 total flexion- extension and L1-L2 total lateral flexion values were statistically high in men (p<0.05). The support of pelvic tilt to total lumbosacral flexion was 46.6% in males and 42.1% in females. The support was 36.8% in males and 26.2% in females during extension. Flexion and extension of pelvic tilt values in men were found to be significantly higher than that in women (p<0.05). Conclusion: The normal values of movements of lumbar spine in Turkish people have been determined with 3D motion analysis system",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: To investigate the patients with parotid tumors retrospectively and to evaluate the surgical procedure, histopathologic results, incidence, follow-up time and complications. Patients and Methods: The study included 56 patients (38 males, 18 females; mean age 52.7 years; range 7 to 86 years) who presented with a mass below or in front of the ear between January 2000 and May 2008. The data regarding patient age, sex, surgical procedure, postoperative histopathologic results and follow-up time were recorded. Results: One of the male patients underwent operation twice because of the bilateral parotid mass. According to the postoperative histopathologic results, 37 of the cases were benign (64.9%), and 20 of them were malign (35.1%). Pleomorphic adenoma (13 patients) and Whartin tumor (13 patients) incidence were similar. Partial superficial parotidectomy, superficial parotidectomy, and total parotidectomy were performed. In addition, some of the patients underwent neck dissection. The most frequent complication was transient facial nerve paresis. Conclusion: For the management of benign parotid gland tumors, superficial or partial superficial parotidectomy is a sufficient surgery. For malign tumors, superficial or total parotidectomy; in cases with neck masses, neck dissection; and in cases involving the facial nerve, facial nerve resection and reconstruction should be performed.

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Our study aimed to assess the diagnostic capabilities of mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP)- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for the evaluation of pancreatic malign mass. Patients and Methods: Magnetic resonance images of 17 patients (7 females, 10 males; mean age 63.2±12 years; range 36 to 80 years) suspected of pancreatic tumor by abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography findings, were examined in terms of signal to noise (S/N) and contrast to noise (C/N) ratios before and after administration of Mn-DPDP using T1 A SE, Fat Sat T1 A SE and GRE T1 A sequences. Results: Before and after administration of Mn-DPDP, the increase in S/N ratios of normal pancreatic parenchyma were found as 22.81%, 32.88% and 20% in T1 A SE, Fat Sat T1 A SE and GRE T1 A sequences, respectively. The increase in C/N ratios obtained from signal intensity values of normal pancreatic tissue and tumor were found as 58.69%, 125.41% and 62.06% in T1 A SE, Fat Sat T1 A SE and GRE T1 A sequences, respectively. Furthermore, in all sequences, before and after contrast medium administration, the increase of C/N ratios were found statistically significant (paired Student's t test, p<0.0001). Conclusion: The differences of C/N ratio using Mn-DPDP as a contrast agent may contribute to the diagnosis of pancreatic malign masses.",

Results: It was observed that energy, calcium, magnesium, vitamin A, E, thiamine, folic acid and fiber intakes of the subjects were below the recommended levels, while protein, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and iron intakes exceeded the target levels. Distribution of macronutrients in daily energy consumption was in agreement with the recommended ratios. Nutritional status did not differ between rural and urban areas (p>0.05).

    "previewText": "Abstract “Tinea incognito” is a dermatophytic infection which modifies typical clinical presentation due to improper use of topical or systemic corticosteroids. In this report, we present three cases who had been treated with topical corticosteroid as a result of incorrect diagnosis. The first case, a 30-year-old male patient complained of localized, erythematous, scaling papules and plaques on his genitocrural crease and umbilical region for four months. The second case, a 40-year-old male patient had generalized, erythematous plaques with papules and pustules, and macular hyperpigmentation for one month. The third case, a 23-year-old male patient had erythematous macules with papules on his malar areas for three months. In all presented cases, direct microscopic examination was positive and, in the first and second cases, the fungal cultures were positive for Trichophyton rubrum. The lesions also showed complete resolution with antimycotic treatment. In this report, we have reviewed the recent medical literature about “tinea incognito”.",
