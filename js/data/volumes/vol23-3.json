    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Measuring patient satisfaction is one of the essential parts of determining the quality of medical care. However, for a physician wishing to perform this measurement, there is no practical, commonly used, and Turkish-adapted scoring tool which can be used for different diseases. In this paper, a novel scoring tool called “Visual Analog Patient Satisfaction Scale,” which aims to measure patient satisfaction with medical care, is presented. Study Design: Outcome and patient satisfaction scales were reviewed. A novel scaling system was developed using the experience obtained by the practice and by observations with patients. Results: This scale includes a vertical line and accompanying two faces at its inferior and superior ends, representing complete dissatisfaction and full satisfaction. The patient signs the point on the line which matches his/her level of satisfaction with the medical care. The scoring is made between 0 to 10. The Visual Analog Patient Satisfaction Scale takes advantage of two validated and commonly-used scales (Visual Analog Pain Scale and Wong-Baker Scale). It is an easy-to-understand and practical scoring tool which can be applied to patients of every age and educational level. The drawback of the scale is its insensitivity to the components of satisfaction, in other words, what makes the patient satisfied or dissatisfied. Conclusion: By knowing its limitations, one can use the scale to measure “the general level of satisfaction with medical care” objectively and practically.",

Patients and Methods: The data of 1273 patients with cerebrovascular disease, admitted within three years, were evaluated retrospectively. 160 patients (130 ischemic, 30 haemorrhagic) with epileptic seizures, developing after cerebrovascular diseases were included in this study. The association between the risk factors of stroke and seizure development, types of seizures, electroencephalographic findings, time distribution of seizures, types and localisations of lesions were evaluated. 640 patients with cerebrovascular disease, admitted to our clinic at the same time period, were included as control subjects. Results: The ratio of epileptic convulsions within one month follow-up period was 12.6% for all patients during the three years follow-up. Multivariant analyses revealed that independent risk factors for convulsion were cortical localisation of lesions, infections and metabolic disturbances were in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and cortical lesions and infections in patients with haemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease. The ratio of convulsion was significantly higher in patients with total anterior circulation ischemic lesion. Conclusion: Patients with cortical lesions and anterior circulation lesions had an increased risk for convulsions, and convulsions increased mortality.

But, since experimental neuropathic pain models in mice are insufficient, there is a need to develop new models. Study Design: We described a novel, easily performed, mouse model of neuropathic pain based on a unilateral tight ligation of the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve. In this model, the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve was tightly ligated and the common peroneal and the sural branches were left intact. Nerve injury-induced mechanical allodynia was assessed with von Frey filaments, and a plantar analgesic meter was used to assess thermal hyperalgesia. Results: Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia developed within 3 days after tibial nerve ligation and was present during the one month measurement period. Conclusion: Tibial nerve ligation, is a new, modified experimental model which enables the use of mice in neuropathic pain experiments and may especially be useful in clarifying mechanisms of neuropathic pain in genetically modified mice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for obesity among reproductive age and postmenopausal women aged between 20-64 years in a semi-urban area. Study Design: In this cross-sectional and analytic study conducted in Urla Health Center District in İzmir, 297 women was selected with systematic sampling method from a total of 3689 women aged 20-64 years. Obesity prevalence was taken as 30%, deviation as 5% and 96.3% of all women (n=286) could be reached. Data were collected through a face to face questionnaire and by body weight and height measurements. Obesity was defined as a body mass index of >30 kg/m2. Results: Among all women, 82.5% were primary school graduates and/or never attended school; 94.4% were not in employment. The prevalence of obesity was 22.2% among women between 20-49 years and 41.1% among women between 50-64 years. All women aged 50-64 years were in menopausal period, and 6 women aged 20-49 years of age were in perimenopausal period. Univariate analysis showed that obesity was significantly associated with age (≥50 years, p=0.004), number of births (≥3 births, p=0.019), having a first degree obese relative (p<0.001), chronic diseases (p=0.034), and consumption of foods rich in carbohydrates (p=0.034). According to multivariate logistic regression analysis which included the above mentioned variables and oral contraceptive use; chronic diseases (p<0.001), obesity in the family (p<0.001) and high consumption of carbohydrate-rich foods (p=0.030) significantly increased obesity. There was no correlation between age and obesiy. Conclusion: It was observed that 25.9% of 20-64 years old women in semi-urban area were obese and obesity increased with age. The genetic and environmental factors, chronical diseases and variables regarding reproductive health affect obesity prevalence. <",
