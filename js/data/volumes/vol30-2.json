Results: Genotype and allele frequencies differed significantly between the ischemic stroke and control groups (P<0.05).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Despite the modern antibiotherapies applied in the practice of otorhinolaryngology, the orbital complications of sinusitis are still considered a serious threat to essential functions of the eye, including loss of vision, and at worst, life threatening symptoms. Aims: The goal of this study is to consider and analyse patients who were treated for these complications in the last decade in our hospital, which is the only tertiary hospital in our country. Study Design: Retrospective analysis of cases. Methods: In our practice, cases treated in the hospital are rhinosinusitis cases where surgical intervention is necessary, or those with a suspicion of complications. Between the years 1999 and 2009 there were 177 cases, the clinical charts of which were reviewed. The cases that are omitted from this study are those involving soft tissues, bone, and intracranial complications. The diagnoses were determined based on anamnesis, anterior rhinoscopy, x-rays of the sinuses with the Water’s projection or where there was a suspicion of a complication, and CT scans with coronal and axial projections. In all cases, intensive treatment was initiated with a combination of cefalosporines, aminoglycosides and Proetz manoeuvre. When an improvement in the conditions did not occur within 24-48 hours, we intervened with a surgical procedure, preferably the Lynch-Patterson external frontoethmoidectomy. Results: In our study, we encountered 35 cases (19.8%) of orbital complications with an average age of 25 (range: 3-75); Palpebral inflammatory oedema (15), orbital cellulitis (10), subperiosteal abscess (6), orbital abscess (3), and cavernous sinus thrombosis (1 patient). The average time that patients remained in hospital was 4.6 days; for those with orbital complications this was 7 days. Conclusion: Orbital complications of sinusitis are considered to be severe pathologies. The appearance of oedema in the corner of the eye should be evaluated immediately and the means to exclude acute sinusitis should be taken under serious consideration.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The diagnosis of abdominal wall endometrioma (AWE) is often confused with other surgical conditions. Certain factors relating to knowledge of the clinical history of the disease make correct diagnosis and treatment difficult. Aims: To present the clinical findings and ultrasonographic (US) features of AWE with special emphasis on size-related features. Study Design: This study reviewed abdominal wall endometriomas during a 2-year period in the Radiology Department of Sifa University Hospital, Izmir. Methods: Eleven women (mean age 32.6 years) with 12 scar endometriomas (mean diameter 29.2 mm) were consecutively evaluated by US and Colour Doppler examination (CDUS) prior to surgery. Lesions were grouped into large (≥3 cm) and small nodules. Vascularisation was classified as location (central, peripheral and mixed) and severity (absent, moderately vascular and hypervascular). In each patient, the nature of pain (absent, cyclic: associated with menstruation and continuous), historical and clinical data were documented. Four patients underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging and their findings were presented. Fisher’s exact test, χ2 test for categorical data and the unpaired T-test for continuous variables were used for statistical analysis. Results: In all the women, US of the AWE showed the presence of a solid hypoechoic mass (less echogenic than the surrounding hyperechoic fat) within the abdominal wall. There was a significant correlation between AWE sizes with repeated caesareans and the mean time between the last operation and admission to hospital (p<0.05). Large endometriomas showed increased central vascularity (p<0.05). Cyclic pain was more frequent in small lesions, whereas continuous pain was more commonly found in patients with larger lesions (p<0.05). Conclusion: AWE is often misdiagnosed clinically because endometriosis may occur years after the caesarean section, the pain is often non-cyclic in nature, and there is not always a palpable tender mass. The sonographic and Doppler findings, along with proper correlation with clinical data, may substantially contribute to the correct diagnosis of endometrioma.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Acne is the most common skin disease, affecting nearly 85% of the population as well as their lives. Acne can severely affect social and psychological functioning. Patients with acne may have anxiety, depression, decreased self-esteem, interpersonal difficulties, unemployment, social withdrawal, and even suicidal intent. Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the temperament and character inventory (TCI) of patients with acne and to compare the results with those of healthy controls. Study Design: Case-control study Methods: The study population consisted of 47 patients with acne, and 40 healthy control subjects. All participants were instructed to complete a self-administered 240-item TCI and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: In this study, the scores for the temperament properties Worry and pessimism (HA1) and Dependence (RD4) and the character properties Social acceptance (C1) and Integrated conscience (C5) were found to be higher in acne patients than in healthy controls (p<0.05). Compared to the controls, depression and anxiety scores were found to be markedly higher in the patients with acne. Acne type correlated positively with the Disorderliness (NS4) subscale of Novelty seeking (NS) and anxiety. Additionally, acne type correlated negatively with the Attachment (RD3) subscale of Reward Dependence (RD), with the Transpersonal identification (ST2) and Spiritual acceptance (ST3) subscales of Self-Trancendence (ST), and with the Compassion (C4) subscale of Cooperativeness (C). Conclusion: Studies in this area may lead to the development of specific and focused interventions for TCI in patients with acne vulgaris.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The finger-tapping test is a commonly employed quantitative assessment tool used to measure motor performance in the upper extremities. This task is a complex motion that is affected by external stimuli, mood and health status. The complexity of this task is difficult to explain with a single average intertap-interval value (time difference between successive tappings) which only provides general information and neglects the temporal effects of the aforementioned factors. Aims: This study evaluated the time course of average intertap-interval values and the patterns of variation in both the right and left hands of right-handed subjects using a computer-based finger-tapping system. Study Design: Cross sectional study. Methods: Thirty eight male individuals aged between 20 and 28 years (Mean±SD = 22.24±1.65) participated in the study. Participants were asked to perform single-finger-tapping test for 10 seconds of test period. Only the results of right-handed (RH) 35 participants were considered in this study. The test records the time of tapping and saves data as the time difference between successive tappings for further analysis. The average number of tappings and the temporal fluctuation patterns of the intertap-intervals were calculated and compared. The variations in the intertap-interval were evaluated with the best curve fit method. Results: An average tapping speed or tapping rate can reliably be defined for a single-finger tapping test by analysing the graphically presented data of the number of tappings within the test period. However, a different presentation of the same data, namely the intertap-interval values, shows temporal variation as the number of tapping increases. Curve fitting applications indicate that the variation has a biphasic nature. Conclusion: The measures obtained in this study reflect the complex nature of the finger-tapping task and are suggested to provide reliable information regarding hand performance.

Conclusion: The measures obtained in this study reflect the complex nature of the finger-tapping task and are suggested to provide reliable information regarding hand performance. Moreover, the equation reflects both the variations in and the general patterns associated with the task.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Vocal fold hyperplastic lesions are premalignant lesions that can be treated effectively by removal of the lesions surgically. Aims: The aim of this study was to discuss the success of surgery in patients with vocal fold hyperplastic lesions in terms of preserving vibratory function by comparing the preoperative and postoperative videolaryngostroboscopy findings. Study Design: The medical charts and videolaryngostroboscopic recordings of patients diagnosed with hyperplastic lesions on the vocal folds were reviewed retrospectively. Methods: Twenty seven patients with unilateral lesions who underwent type1 subepithelial cordectomy were enrolled in the study. The videolaryngostroboscopic recordings were evaluated by three raters who were not the operating surgeon and who were blinded to the histology of patients. To evaluate the videolaryngostroboscopic findings, a form, which is a modification of criteria described by Hirano and Bless, was used. Preoperative and 6th month postoperative videolaryngostroboscopic recordings were compared with each other and with recordings of the control group, which included 50 healthy volunteers. Results: All videolaryngostroboscopic findings, except false cord vibration, were significantly improved after surgery. Conclusion: The principle of vocal fold surgery in patients with benign lesions is to preserve the vibratory tissue. This principle also applies to patients with hyperplastic lesions that are premalignant. The hydrodissection technique may be beneficial for this purpose.",

HL comprises 1% of all cancer cases and 14% of all lymphoma cases. Aims: We designed a retrospective study to investigate the clinical features and prognostic factors of HL patients diagnosed at an experienced oncology centre. Study Design: Retrospective study. Methods: Demographic characteristics, histopathological and clinical features, treatment modalities and response to treatment were obtained from hospital records. Dates of initial diagnosis, remission and relapse, last visit and death were recorded for survival analyses. Results: We analysed data of 391 HL patients (61% male, 39% female; mean age 35.7±15.1 years). The most common classical HL histological subtype was nodular sclerosing HL (NSHL) (42.7%). The most common stage was II 50.4%. The most common chemotherapy regimen was doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) (70.6%). Five and 10-year survival rates were 90% and 84%, respectively. Early-stage patients with good prognostic factors had better overall and relapse-free survival rates. The presence of “B” symptoms, albumin level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score, and LDH were prognostic factors that affect the survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Conclusion: This is the first study that demonstrates the demographic, clinical and prognostic features of HL patients in Turkey, and provides a general picture of the HL patients in our country.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Intrathecal α2 agonists prolong the duration of action of local anesthetics and reduce the required dose. Dexmedetomidine is an α2 receptor agonist and its α2/α1 selectivity is 8 times higher than that of clonidine. Aims: In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of adding dexmedetomidine to intrathecal levobupivacaine on the onset time and duration of motor and sensory blocks. Study Design: Randomized controlled study. Methods: Patients were randomly assigned into two groups. Group L (n= 30) patients received 3 mL (15 mg) of 0.5% levobupivacaine +0.3 mL normal saline and Group LD (n= 30) patients received 3 mL (15 mg) of 0.5% levobupivacaine + 0.3 mL (3 μg) dexmedetomidine. Sensory block onset time, block reaching time to T10 dermatome, the most elevated dermatome level, two dermatome regression time, sensory block complete regression time as well as motor block onset time, reaching Bromage 3 and regressing to Bromage 0 were recorded. Results: Sensory and motor block onset times were shorter in Group LD than in Group L (p<0.001). The regression of the sensory block to S1 dermatome and Bromage 0 were longer in Group LD than Group L (p<0.001). The two dermatome regression time was longer in Group LD than Group L (p< 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in blood pressure and heart rate.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Aortopulmonary window (APW) is a communication between the ascending aorta and the pulmonary artery in the presence of two separate semilunar valves and is the rarest of septal defects. Aims: To present our experience with the diagnosis and outcome of APW cases. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Between June 2003 and October 2011, thirteen patients were diagnosed with APW. Clinical features of patients, findings of echocardiographic and angiographic examination, results of surgical intervention and follow-up were reviewed retrospectively. Results: Eleven children (10 days to 16 years), underwent surgical correction of APW. In a 12-month-old boy, the defect was repaired by the transcatheter approach. In addition to APW repair, closure of VSD was performed in 2 patients. APW were associated with interruption in two patients; one also had a complex pathology. None of the patients died due to complications of surgical or transcatheter procedures. After a median follow-up period of 40 months, the patients were asymptomatic and none of them required additional medication, except for the patient with complex pathology including an interrupted aortic arch, who underwent balloon angioplasty for recoarctation. Conclusion: In any infant with the findings of congestive heart failure and failure to thrive, APW must be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis. In isolated APW cases before 6 months of age, echocardiography is often sufficient for diagnosis. In complex cases, cardiac catheterisation is performed for the comprehensive evaluation of associated defects. After 6 months, cardiac catheterisation could be utilised to perform vasoreactivity testing and, if possible, to close the defect.",

Saliva flow rate, buffer capacity and microorganism content are very important in the maintenance of oral health. Aims: We aimed to evaluate saliva flow rate, pH, buffer capacity and Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli content along with the decayed, missing, and filled tooth index in Behçet’s patients. Study Design: Case-control study Methods: Forty patients with active Behçet disease [female:male (F/M) 21/19, mean age 31.05±11.08 years] and forty healthy persons (F/M 21/19, mean age 31.03±9.14 years) were included in the study. The oral region was first examined, and the decayed, missing, and filled tooth index was calculated for each person. Stimulated saliva was collected and divided into two separate millimetric tubes to calculate the buffer capacity of the saliva, determine Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli levels and measure the pH of the saliva. A Caries Risk Test buffer strip was used to calculate the buffer capacity. Caries Risk Test bacterial kit was used to determine Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli levels. A pH meter was used to measure the pH of the saliva. Results: The mean saliva pH of the patients was higher than the controls (7.76±0.51, 7.18±0.46, respectively) (p<0.001). The mean level of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli in patients was higher than controls (p<0.05). The mean decayed, missing, and filled tooth index of patients was 9.82±6.59 (range 1-28), while the mean decayed, missing, and filled tooth index of the controls was 6.05±3.35 (range 1-16) (p<0.01). There were no significant differences between the patients and the controls with respect to saliva flow rate and saliva buffer capacity (p>0.05). Conclusion: We think that the maintenance of oral health by effective, regular tooth brushing, regular dental check-ups and dental treatment for Behçet patients is very important for the prevention and therapy of Behçet disease.",

Study Design: Case-control study Methods: Forty patients with active Behçet disease [female:male (F/M) 21/19, mean age 31.05±11.08 years] and forty healthy persons (F/M 21/19, mean age 31.03±9.14 years) were included in the study. The oral region was first examined, and the decayed, missing, and filled tooth index was calculated for each person. Stimulated saliva was collected and divided into two separate millimetric tubes to calculate the buffer capacity of the saliva, determine Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli levels and measure the pH of the saliva. A Caries Risk Test buffer strip was used to calculate the buffer capacity. Caries Risk Test bacterial kit was used to determine Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli levels. A pH meter was used to measure the pH of the saliva. Results: The mean saliva pH of the patients was higher than the controls (7.76±0.51, 7.18±0.46, respectively) (p<0.001). The mean level of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli in patients was higher than controls (p<0.05). The mean decayed, missing, and filled tooth index of patients was 9.82±6.59 (range 1-28), while the mean decayed, missing, and filled tooth index of the controls was 6.05±3.35 (range 1-16) (p<0.01). There were no significant differences between the patients and the controls with respect to saliva flow rate and saliva buffer capacity (p>0.05). Conclusion: We think that the maintenance of oral health by effective, regular tooth brushing, regular dental check-ups and dental treatment for Behçet patients is very important for the prevention and therapy of Behçet disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The adhesion process of Borrelia burgdorferi to susceptible host cell has not yet been completely understood regarding the function of OspA, OspB and OspC proteins and a conflict exists in the infection process. Aims: The adhesion rates of pathogenic (low BSK medium passaged or susceptible rat joint tissue co-cultivated ) or non-pathogenic Borrelia burgdorferi (high BSK medium passaged) isolate (FNJ) to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured on coverslips and the synthesis of OspA and OspC proteins were investigated to analyze the infection process of this bacterium. Study Design: In-vitro study. Methods: Spirochetes were cultured in BSK medium or in a LEW/N rat tibiotarsal joint tissue feeder layer supported co-culture system using ESG co-culture medium and labelled with 3H-adenine for 48 hours. SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, Immunogold A labeling as well as radiolabeling experiments were used to compare pathogenic or non pathogenic spirochetes during the adhesion process. Results: Tissue co-cultured B. burgdorferi adhered about ten times faster than BSK-grown spirochetes. Trypsin inhibited attachment to HUVEC and co-culture of trypsinized spirochetes with tissues reversed the inhibition. Also, the synthesis of OspC protein by spirochetes was increased in abundance after tissue co-cultures, as determined by SDS-PAGE and by electron microscopy analysis of protein A-immunogold staining by anti-OspC antibodies. OspA protein was synthesized in similar quantities in all Borrelia cultures analyzed by the same techniques. Conclusion: Low BSK passaged or tissue co-cultured pathogenic Lyme disease spirochetes adhere to HUVEC faster than non-pathogenic high BSK passaged forms of this bacterium. Spirochetes synthesized OspC protein during host tissue-associated growth. However, we did not observe a reduction of OspA synthesis during host tissue co-cultivation in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Kawasaki disease is treated by immunoglobulin therapy, which has adverse side effects like renal damage. Aims: The aim of the present study was to explore the effectiveness of triptolide, a compound derived from threewingnut that has anti-inflammatory effects, on the treatment of Kawasaki disease in a mouse model. Study Design: Animal experiment. Methods: A mouse model of Kawasaki disease was established through exposure to Candida albicans by intraperitoneal injection. Exposed mice were then randomly divided into several groups (each n=15): model group (saline-treated), low- or high-dose triptolide groups (0.2 mg/kg or 0.4 mg/kg, respectively), and IVIG (high-dose immunoglobulin) group (1 g/kg body weight). Unexposed mice served as an additional control group. Nine weeks from the initial exposure, mice were euthanised and coronary tissues and blood samples were harvested. The rate of apoptosis was detected by TUNEL, and ICAM-1 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in coronary endothelial cells. Serum TNF-α levels were detected by ELISA. Results: Compared to mice in the (unexposed) control group, apoptosis of endothelial cells, ICAM-1 expression, and serum TNF-α levels were significantly increased in all exposed mice (p<0.05), confirming the presence of disease. However, treatment with triptolide or IVIG significantly lowered these measures compared to untreated exposed mice (model group; p<0.05). Conclusions: Triptolide treatment reduces markers of coronary endothelial inflammation in a mouse model of Kawasaki disease, similar to IVIG treatment, and therefore may be a useful alternative therapy for this disease.",

Acetyl L-carnitine protects cells against mitochondrial and nuclear damage induced by chemotherapy. Aims: The aim of this study was to examine the protective effects of acetyl L-carnitine on cisplatin-induced gonadotoxicity in testicular structures. Study Design: Animal experiment. Methods: Twenty-four male Wistar albino rats were divided into four Groups (n=6): Group 1 (control) was administered saline; Group 2 was administered acetyl L-carnitine; Group 3 was administered cisplatin; and Group 4 was pre-treated with acetyl L-carnitine before cisplatin administration. After 72hr of treatment with cisplatin, the rats were sacrificed, and the testicular tissues were removed. Morphometric, histomorphologic and immunohistochemical analyses were conducted. Results: At the end of the experiment, Group 3 was characterised by statistically significant weight loss, a degenerative appearance of the seminiferous tubules in the peripheral region, separation of spermatogenic cell series from the tubular wall, cellular debris in the lumen and central interstitial oedema. Sperm morphology appeared to be abnormal. Tubular diameter and wall thickness decreased, and the number of TUNEL- and active caspase-positive cells increased compared with the other Groups. The histological findings in Group 4 were better than those in Group 3. Conclusion: It was concluded that the prophylactic use of acetyl L-carnitine protects against cisplatin-induced testicular tissue damage.",

Case Report: A 17-year-old female patient presented with repeated refractory airway infection. She also had bronchiectasis and situs inversus. Electron microscopic evaluation of her nasal mucosa revealed ciliary defect and confirmed the diagnosis of KS. She underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) followed by long-term postoperative debridement of the sinonasal cavity. This treatment reduced chronic rhinosinusitis and protected against subsequent airway infection in a 7-year follow-up.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Pityriasis rosea is an acute inflamatory skin disease that the etiology is unknown but some viral agents like human herpes virus-6 and 7 and drugs are suspected. Case report: A-58-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C was being followed up in our hospital. Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) alfa-2b (100 µg per week) and ribavirin (1000 mg/day) was started. In the third month of this treatment, the patient was diagnosed with pityriasis rosea (PR), which was confirmed by skin biopsy. PEG-IFN alfa-2b treatment for chronic hepatitis C was maintained and no therapy was given for PR. The lesions spontaneously improved within 5 weeks. Conclusion: Interferon and ribavirin have several cutaneous side effects. Our case is the first case of PR, emerged in a patient with chronic hepatitis C while receiving PEG-IFN alfa 2b and ribavirin.",
