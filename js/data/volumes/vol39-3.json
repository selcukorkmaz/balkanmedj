    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Endotracheal tube (ETT) is an important risk factor for the development of Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as it acts as a reservoir for infectious microorganisms and bypasses the host’s defenses. One of the preventive measures for VAP is endotracheal tube composition. It has been reported that biofilm formation is reduced by using ETTs coated with pure silver or silver compounds. However, noble metal-alloy ETTs have not been adequately studied.Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of noble metal alloy ETT (coated Bactiguard Infection Protection ETTs) in preventing VAP compared to standard non-coated ETTs in patients requiring ≥ 48 hours of mechanical ventilation and presenting for coma due to drug intoxication.Study Design: Randomized controlled study.Methods: Participants were randomized using sealed envelopes with a concealed 1:1 allocation to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group used a noble metal–alloy ETT, while the control group received standard ETT. The primary outcomes were the incidence of VAP (per ventilated patients) and the duration of mechanical ventilation.Results: Initially, a total of 188 patients were assessed for eligibility, and the final allocation group consisted of 180 patients, who were subsequently randomized into the intervention group (n = 97) and control group (n = 83). The incidence of VAP in the intervention and control groups was 27.83% and 43.16% (P = 0.03), and the VAP ratio per 1000 ventilation days was 51.26/1000 and 83.38/1000 (P = 0.01), respectively. The mean durations of mechanical ventilation were 3.2 ± 0.78 in the intervention group and 5.03 ± 1.88 in the control group (P = 0.22). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of mortality and duration of hospital stay.Conclusion: Noble metal-alloy ETT reduces the incidence of VAP, ventilation days, and ICU stay for patients in mechanical ventilation.",

The first and second serum samples were taken 1 and 7 months, respectively, after the PCR positivity. S1/RBD-specific IgG antibody response was assayed using anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac ELISA (IgG) kit (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany). The neutralizing antibodies were investigated in 57 patients whose IgG test results were above the cut-off value.Results: In 57 patients with SARS-CoV-2 IgG, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG quantitative antibody levels significantly decreased after 7 months (Z = −2.197, p = 0.028). A correlation was detected between the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and nAb percent inhibition (IH%) levels detected in 1 month (rs = 0.496, p < 0.001), but without significant correlation in serum samples taken on 7 months. The nAb IH% levels of the first and second were compared for COVID-19 severity and revealed no statistical difference (p = 0.256). In the second serum sample, the nAb IH%s of patients with moderate COVID-19 showed a statistically significant difference from patients with mild COVID-19 (p = 0.018), but without significant differences between severe and moderate or mild COVID-19.Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 quantitative IgG antibody titers are significantly reduced at long-term follow-up (> 6 months). Due to the limited information on seroconversion, comprehensive studies should be conducted for long-term follow-up of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2.",

Finally, the effects of the biomimetic system on the expression of calcium-binding protein 39 (CAB39) and migration inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected using the real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.Results: After coating the CAs with MEXO, their particle size increased from 113.1 ± 3.4 nm to 143.2 ± 14 nm, and their surface potential decreased from 26.34 ± 0.4 mV to −10.3 ± 1.6 mV.

The MEXO was detected by a bicinchoninic acid assay. The as-prepared biomimetic nanoparticles were then characterized to determine their protective effects on microRNAs (miRNAs). Moreover, the influence of the miR-144-MEXO/CA-miR-451a nanoparticles on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OSCCs was evaluated. Finally, the effects of the biomimetic system on the expression of calcium-binding protein 39 (CAB39) and migration inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected using the real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot.Results: After coating the CAs with MEXO, their particle size increased from 113.1 ± 3.4 nm to 143.2 ± 14 nm, and their surface potential decreased from 26.34 ± 0.4 mV to −10.3 ± 1.6 mV. The expression of the MEXO marker protein was also observed on the biomimetic nanoparticles’ surface. The system can protect miRNAs from RNase A degradation. Compared with the CAs cotransfected with free miR-144/451a cluster, CAs that are coloaded with miR-144-MEXO/CA-miR-451a nanoparticles substantially reduced the viability (p < 0.001), migration (p = 0.023), and invasion (p = 0.004) of OSCC. These findings revealed the successful construction of biomimetic nanoparticles coloaded with the miR-144/451a cluster. CAB39 and MIF expression in OSCC treated with miR-144-MEXO/CA-miR-451a nanoparticles have significantly decreased compared with the miR-144/451a group (p < 0.05). Thus, the nanoparticles can effectively improve the inhibitory effects of the miR-144/451a cluster on OSCC.Conclusion: This study provided a new idea for the application of gene cotransfection to tumor treatment.",
