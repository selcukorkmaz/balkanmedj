    "abstract": "Neurosurgery represents a zero tolerance environment for medical errors, especially preventable ones like all types of wrong site surgery, complications due to the incorrect positioning of patients for neurosurgical interventions and complications due to failure of the devices required for the specific procedure. Following the excellent and encouraging results of the safety checklists in intensive care medicine and in other surgical areas, the checklist was naturally introduced in neurosurgery. To date, the reported world experience with neurosurgical checklists is limited to 15 series with fewer than 20,000 cases in various neurosurgical areas. The purpose of this review was to study the reported neurosurgical checklists according to the following parameters: year of publication; country of origin; area of neurosurgery; type of neurosurgical procedureelective or emergency; person in charge of the checklist completion; participants involved in completion; whether they prevented incorrect site surgery; whether they prevented complications due to incorrect positioning of the patients for neurosurgical interventions; whether they prevented complications due to failure of the devices required for the specific procedure; their specific aims; educational preparation and training; the time needed for checklist completion; study duration and phases; number of cases included; barriers to implementation; efforts to implementation; team appreciation; and safety outcomes. Based on this analysis, it could be concluded that neurosurgical checklists represent an efficient, reliable, cost-effective and time-saving tool for increasing patient safety and elevating the neurosurgeons’ self-confidence. Every neurosurgical department must develop its own neurosurgical checklist or adopt and modify an existing one according to its specific features and needs in an attempt to establish or develop its safety culture.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia due to thrombocyte destruction mediated by autoantibodies; however, cytotoxic and defective regulatory T-lymphocytes play an important role in its pathogenesis. While childhood ITP is usually acute, self-limiting and generally seasonal in nature, ITP in adults is usually chronic; its relation with seasons has not been studied. Aims: We investigated whether months and/or seasons have triggering roles in adults with ITP. Study Design: Descriptive study. Methods: A retrospective case review of adult patients with primary ITP diagnosed at various University Hospitals in cities where Mediterranean climate is seen was performed. Demographic data, date of referral and treatments were recorded. Corticosteroid-resistant, chronic and refractory cases were determined. Relation between sex, corticosteroid-resistant, chronic and refractory ITP with the seasons was also investigated. Results: The study included 165 patients (124 female, mean age=42.8±16.6). Most cases of primary ITP were diagnosed in the spring (p=0.015). Rates of patients diagnosed according to the seasons were as follows: 35.8% in spring, 23% in summer, 20.6% in fall, and 20.6% in winter. With respect to months, the majority of cases occurred in May (18.2%). Time of diagnosis according to the seasons did not differ between genders (p=0.699). First-line treatment was corticosteroids in 97.3%, but 35% of the cases were corticosteroid-resistant. Steroid-resistant patients were mostly diagnosed in the spring (52.1%) (p=0.001). ITP was chronic in 52.7% of the patients and they were also diagnosed mostly in the spring (62.7%) (p=0.149). Conclusion: This is the first study showing seasonal association of ITP in adults and we have observed that ITP in adults is mostly diagnosed in the spring. The reason why more patients are diagnosed in the spring may be due to the existence of atmospheric pollens reaching maximum levels in the spring in places where a Mediterranean climate is seen.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Allergic rhinitis is characterized by a chronic inflammation of nasal mucosa and represents a risk factor for asthma occurrence. H1 antihistamines reduce the symptoms of rhinitis, but some compounds may have anti-inflammatory properties. Aims: We evaluated the plasma level of some cytokines in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) and their evolution after a 4-week treatment with H1 antihistamines, as well as the risk of asthma after 1.5 years. Study Design: Randomized clinical trial. Methods: Eighty-five patients with PAR and 30 healthy volunteers were included in the study. The patients with PAR were randomly divided into 2 groups: 41 patients treated with 5 mg/day desloratadine and 44 patients under 5 mg/day levocetirizine for 4 weeks. The clinical and biological evaluations were performed before and after treatment and included rhinitis symptoms and total symptoms score, type of sensitization, and plasmatic levels of total IgE, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α. Results: IL-8 and TNF-α were significantly increased in patients with PAR compared to healthy volunteers (5.85 vs 3.12, p<0.001 and 2.32 vs 1.06, p<0.001, respectively). Both H1 antihistamines reduce all symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including nasal congestion and the plasmatic level of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α, after 4 weeks of treatment. The reduction of cytokine levels was not influenced by patients’ age, sex, duration or severity of rhinitis, or type of sensitization. Levocetirizine has a superior effect compared to desloratadine in reducing the rhinitis symptoms and cytokines’ level. Twenty eight (32.9%) of the patients presented asthma symptoms after 1.5 years. The occurrence of asthma was influenced by house dust sensitization (OR-14.6; CI 95% 1.8-116.3; p=0.01), but baseline values of cytokines were not predictive factors for its appearance. Conclusion: Levocetirizine and desloratadine as a prolonged therapy reduce plasmatic levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with PAR. Levocetirizine has a better effect on decreasing the symptoms and plasmatic levels of IL-1β and IL-8.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Preeclampsia and Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelet (HELLP) syndrome are important disorders affecting the health of both the mother and fetus. Prediction of the maternal and perinatal outcomes at early and late gestational age is important for the management of both disorders. Aims: The purpose of the study was to investigate adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes in severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome cases according to gestational age. Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: One hundred and ninety-seven pregnancies with severe preeclampsia and 56 pregnancies with HELLP syndrome were included the study. Clinical characteristics and adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes were noted from medical records. Participants were divided into two groups at <34 and ≥34 weeks’ gestation: the severe preeclampsia group and the HELLP syndrome group. The differences between the outcomes in the groups were investigated. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t test, Fisher Exact test and Yates’ Chi-square test. Results: Eclampsia was more common in HELLP syndrome cases at <34 weeks’ gestation (p 0.028). However, eclampsia rates were statistically similar between groups at ≥34 weeks’ gestation. The requirement for blood products transfusion was higher in the HELLP group at all gestational weeks. No statistical difference was found in perinatal outcomes between severe preeclampsia and HELLP groups at less than and more than 34 weeks’ gestation. Conclusion: Eclampsia risk increases in HELLP syndrome, especially at gestations less than 34 weeks. Perinatal morbidity at less than 34 weeks’ gestation and mortality were similar in severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome cases at the same gestational age.",

Although allergen-specific antibodies play a main role in the allergic airway inflammation, neuronal inflammation may also contribute to the symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Neuronal inflammation is primarily caused by the stimulation of sensory nerve endings with histamine. It has been shown that neurotrophins may also have a role in allergic reactions and neuronal inflammation. Nerve growth factor, neurotrophin 3 (NT-3), neurotrophin 4/5 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor are members of the neurotrophin family.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Proliferative scars are benign fibrotic proliferations which demonstrate abnormal wound healing in response to skin injuries. As postulated in the “response to injury hypothesis”, atherosclerosis is also triggered by an endothelial injury. Keloid and atherosclerotic processes have many pathophysiological and cytological features in common. Aims: In this study, we investigated the relationship between proliferative scars and endothelial function in surgically revascularized patients. We aimed to test the hypothesis that atherosclerosis is a wound healing abnormality. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Consecutive patients who were admitted to the cardiology outpatient clinic with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting operation were evaluated. Thirty-three patients with proliferative scars at the median sternotomy site formed the keloid group, and 36 age- and sex-matched patients with no proliferative scar at the median sternotomy site formed the control group. Endothelial function was evaluated by flow-mediated vasodilatation of the brachial artery via ultrasonograhic examination. Results: There is no signicant difference according to the demographic data, biochemical parameters, clinical parameters and number of grafts between keloid and control groups. Endothelial-dependent vasodilatory response was lower in the keloid group than the control group (9.30±3.5 and 18.68±8.2, respectively; p=0.001).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is the most common acute optic neuropathy in patients over the age of 50 and is the second most common cause of permanent optic nerve-related visual loss in adults after glaucoma. Although the precise cause of NAION remains elusive, the etiology of NAION is believed to be multifactorial. Aims: To evaluate the utility of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a simple and readily available prognostic factor for clinical disease activity in patients with NAION. Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: Forty-five patients with the diagnosis of NAION and 50 age- and sex-matched controls with/without any systemic or ocular diseases except cataract were retrospectively enrolled in the study. Demographic characteristics and laboratory findings including complete blood count of all patients and control subjects were obtained from the electronic medical record. The neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were recorded and the NLR was calculated. Results: White blood cell, neutrophil, NLR and platelet values of the NAION patients were significantly higher than those of the controls (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.004, p=0.037, respectively). Initial NLR values were negatively correlated with initial and the third month best corrected visual acuity levels in the study group. The optimum NLR cut-off point for NAION was 1.94.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) have KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) mutations affecting receptor tyrosine kinase activity and do not benefit from classic treatment regimens. Aims: The aim of this study was to review the algorithm that may be followed for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis in GISTs by investigating the histomorphological parameters and expression characteristics of classical immunohistochemical antibodies used in routine tests in addition to DOG1 expression. Study Design: Diagnostic accuracy study. Methods: We reevaluated the histological and immunohistochemical parameters of 37 GISTs. The standard immunohistochemical diagnosis and differential diagnosis panel antibodies (CD117, PDGFRα, CD34, vimentin, desmin, SMA, S-100, and Ki67) were studied on the tumor sections. We also used the popular marker DOG1 antibody with accepted sensitivity for GISTs in recent years and the PDGFRα immune marker for which the benefit in routine practice is discussed. Results: Classification according to progressive disease risk groups of the 37 cases revealed that 54% were in the high risk, 19% in the moderate risk, 16% in the low risk, 8% in the very low risk and 8% in the no risk group.Cytological atypia, necrosis, mucosal invasion and the Ki67 index were found to be related to the progressive disease risk groups of the tumors (p<0.05).Positive immunoreaction was observed with CD117 and PDGFRα in all GISTs in the study (100%).

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: We evaluated the differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. Aims: To investigate the value of diffusion weighted imaging on the differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary lesions. Study Design: Randomized prospective study. Methods: This prospective study included 48 solitary pulmonary nodules and masses (18 benign, 30 malignant). Single shot echo planar spin echo diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was performed with two b factors (0 and 1000 s/mm2). Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were calculated. On diffusion weighted (DW) trace images, the signal intensities (SI) of the lesions were visually compared to the SI of the thoracic spinal cord using a 5-point scale: 1: hypointense, 2: moderately hypointense, 3: isointense, 4: moderately hyperintense, 5: significantly hyperintense. For the quantitative evaluation, the lesion to thoracic spinal signal intensity ratios and the ADCs of the lesions were compared between groups. Results: On visual evaluation, taking the density of the spinal cord as a reference, most benign lesions were found to be hypointense, while most of the malignant lesions were evaluated as hyperintense on DWI with a b factor of 1000 s/mm2. In contrast, on T2 weighted images, it was seen that the distinction of malignant lesions from benign lesions was not statistically significant. The ADCs of the malignant lesions were significantly lower than those of benign lesions (mean ADC was 2.02×10-3 mm2/s for malignant lesions, and 1.195×10-3±0.3 mm2/s for benign lesions). Setting the cut-off value at 1.5×10-3, ADC had a sensitivity of 86.7% and a specificity of 88.9% for the differentiation of benign lesions from malignant lesions. Conclusion: DWI may aid in the differential diagnosis of solitary pulmonary lesions.",

There are certain pieces of literature on the subject that reveal changes in mean platelet volume (MPV) values occur in inflammatory and ischemic diseases and that these changes have diagnostic and prognostic significance. However, there are no studies investigating this relationship with adnexal torsion. Aims: The aim of the study is to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic significance of the mean platelet volume value in the early diagnosis of patients with adnexal torsion. Study Design: Case-control study. Methods: Pre-operative demographic data, MPV, leukocyte count and neutrophils to lymphocytes (N/L) ratio in the blood samples of 51 patients, who were operated on preliminary adnexal torsion and diagnosed as adnexal torsion with a benign ovarian cyst (AT group) were retrospectively compared with those of 50 patients who were operated upon because of benign ovarian cysts and without torsion (control group) at this hospital between 2006 and 2014. Results: The mean MPV level was found to be 8.1 (7.1-10.7) fL in the AT group and 7.9 (6.6-10.2) fL in the control group; no statistically significant difference was found between the groups (p>0.05).Leukocyte count and N/L ratio in the AT group were, on average, 12x103/mm3 and 82% respectively and in control group; they were, on average, 7.2x103/mm3 and 59%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Utero-cutaneous fistula (UCF) is an extremely rare entity and only a few case reports have been published. Most UCFs develop secondary to postpartum or postoperative complications. Case Report: A 42 year-old woman began to complain from bleeding and malodorous discharge through her abdominal incision scar. The fistula tract with a thickness of 8 mm was observed between the uterus and wound using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The risks and benefits of conservative treatment have been discussed; the patient demanded definitive treatment, so hysterectomy and excision of the fistulous tract was performed. Histopathology of the fistulous tract showed endometrial epithelization of the tract lined by granulation. Conclusion: There are many causes of such an extremely rare entity. Patients should be counseled for medical or surgical treatment considering their age, accompanied uterine pathologies such as fibroids and fertility expectations.",
