    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Flavonoids are natural compounds with antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and anti-inflammatory effects.Aims: To determine the cytotoxic effects of flavonoids and drug resistance related to P-gp on K562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. We also aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of imatinib and flavonoid combinations.Study Design: Cell culture study.Methods: In this study, K562 cells were treated with apigenin, luteolin, 5-desmethyl sinensetin and the anticancer drug imatinib mesylate. The effect of flavonoids on K562 cell proliferation was detected using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)2,5‑diphenyl‑tetrazolium bromide assay. Concentrations of apigenin, luteolin, and 5-desmethyl sinensetin ranging from 25 to 200 μM and of imatinib from 5 to 50 μM administered for 72 h were studied. Apoptosis/necrosis and P-gp activity were measured using flow cytometry. The combined effects of different concentrations of flavonoids with imatinib were evaluated according to combination index values calculated using CompuSyn software.Results: In our study, the IC50 values for apigenin, luteolin, and 5-desmethyl sinensetin were found to be 140 μM, 100 μM, and >200 μM, respectively. Luteolin (100 μM) had the highest cytotoxic activity of these flavonoids. These results were statistically significant (p<0.05). Among the flavonoids studied, the combination of luteolin and imatinib was the most effective and is therefore recommended for its cytotoxic activity in the K562 cell line. After 72 h of incubation at their respective IC50 concentrations, all flavonoids were associated with an apoptosis rate of approximately 50%. P-glycoprotein activity was increased in all groups. Combination treatment may provide better outcomes in terms of cytotoxicity and thus reduce the dosages of imatinib used. Conclusion: The combination of some flavonoids and imatinib mesylate may increase the cytotoxic effect; However, the antagonistic effect should be considered in combined use on k562 cells.",

While water pipe-related malignancy, pulmonary, infectious, cardiac effects, infertility, and biological effects have been described in a meta-analysis, there are no studies in the literature about its neurologic effects.Aims: To evaluate water pipe-related acute neurological effects and cerebral blood flow through transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and serum S100 calcium binding protein calcium binding protein level measurements. Study Design: Prospective observational study.Methods: Vital signs and baseline carboxyhemoglobin and S100 calcium binding protein levels, cerebral flood changes with transcranial Doppler ultrasound were evaluated and recorded before and after water-pipe smoking.Results: The mean age of the 31 volunteers was 30.61 (±5.67) years, and 24 of them (77.42%) were male. A statistically significant difference was determined in heart rate, oxygen saturation, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure values before and after water-pipe smoking (p<0.001, p=0.035, p=0.009, p=0.021, respectively). Mean carboxyhemoglobin level was 2.68% (±1.68) before, 14.97% (±4.83) after water-pipe smoking (p<0.001). The S100 calcium binding protein level was 25.05 μ/mL (±8.34) at the beginning, 40.71 μ/mL (±14.06) after water-pipe smoking (p<0.001). An increase was determined in peak, and median middle, anterior and posterior cerebral artery blood flow rates, and a decrease was determined in both the pulsatility index and resistivity index values after water-pipe smoking using transcranial Doppler ultrasound.Conclusion: Cerebral vasodilation develops due to the increase in cerebral blood flow rate and the decrease in pulsatility index, resistivity index values, and the elevation in carboxyhemoglobin, S100 calcium binding protein level indicates that water-pipe smoking leads to neuronal damage in the acute period.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy, which minimizes renal function loss due to its nephron sparing nature, has become a standard technique among many experienced centers worldwide for surgical treatment of localized kidney tumors. Although partial nephrectomy will remain the gold standard, we need to improve perioperative management and surgical method to prevent postoperative acute kidney injury. Aims: To demonstrate the frequency of the development of postoperative acute kidney injury following laparoscopic partial nephrectomy in patients with healthy contralateral kidney and determine the early predictive effects of serum neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin on ischemia-reperfusion injury and its association with warm ischemia time.Study Design: Cross-sectional study.Methods: Eighty patients were included. We analyzed tumor size, operating time, duration of anesthesia, and warm ischemia time. Serum samples were obtained for measurement of serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level preoperatively, at the postoperative 2nd hour, and on postoperative days 1 and 2. We used receiver operating characteristic curve for determining the cut-off point of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin to detect postoperative acute kidney injury. Correlation analysis was performed using Spearman’s test.Results: Twenty-seven patients developed acute kidney injury on postoperative day 2, and the neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level increased significantly at the postoperative 2nd hour in the acute kidney injury group (p=0.048). For a cut-off of 129.375 ng/mL neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, the test showed 70.0% sensitivity and 68.3% specificity for the detection of acute kidney injury at the postoperative 2nd hour. For a cut-off of 184.300 ng/mL neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, the test exhibited 73.3% sensitivity and 63.3% specificity for the detection of acute kidney injury on postoperative day 1. A significant correlation was found between warm ischemia time and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level at the postoperative 2nd hour (r=0.398, p=0.003). The creatinine values were significantly higher and the estimated glomerular filtration rates were significantly lower on postoperative days 1 and 2 in the acute kidney injury group compared with those in the non-acute kidney injury group (p<0.001).Conclusion: The neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin may be used as an alternative biomarker to serum creatinine in differentiation of ischemic damage in patients undergoing laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.",

    "previewText": "Abstract Background: An assessment of rhinoplasty from the patient’s perspective, in terms of satisfaction and quality of life, is quite important because these are the predominant factors indicating the success of rhinoplasty.Aims: To translate the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation into Turkish and then validate the new version for use in Turkish patients.Study Design: Validation study.Methods: We enrolled 30 participants who were able to read and write Turkish and underwent primary rhinoplasty. The control group consisted of 58 healthy volunteers with no need for aesthetic or functional nasal surgery. The reliability of the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T was analyzed according to its internal consistency and test-retest reproducibility. Discriminant validity was calculated by comparing the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T scores between the patient and control groups. Responsiveness and sensitivity to changes in rhinoplasty outcomes were analyzed by comparing the patients’ pre- and postoperative Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T scores.Results: The scores for questions 1-6 of the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T, as well as the total scores, were significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group (all p<0.05). In the patient group, the scores for questions 1-6 of the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T, as well as the total scores, were higher postoperatively than preoperatively (all p<0.05). The scores for each Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T question, as well as the total scores, did not differ significantly with respect to test-retest reproducibility (all p>0.05). The internal consistency of the Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T was high, as evidenced by Cronbach’s α values of 0.887 preoperatively and 0.798 postoperatively.Conclusion: The Rhinoplasty Outcomes Evaluation-T constitutes a validated instrument with which to measure rhinoplasty outcomes among Turkish patients.",

Pain and radicular symptoms consistent with the thoracolumbar region were confirmed via abnormal magnetic resonance imaging findings after detailed anamnesis and physical examination. All patients were evaluated before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment using the visual analog scale score. The patient satisfaction scale was used to evaluate the level of patient satisfaction at the end of the treatment at 12 months. Results: The median visual analog scale score was 7.00±0.45 points before treatment and 2.73±0.65 points at 12 months post-procedure and were statistically significant (p<0.001). The results of pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni Corrected Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test showed that there were statistically significant differences. The mean visual analog scale score at the beginning (7.00±0.45) was significantly higher than the mean score of other months. Postoperative improvement was significant with a 99% confidence interval.
