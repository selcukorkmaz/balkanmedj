ITA remnants were suspended in an isolated organ bath. Constrictor or relaxant responses to dopamine were recorded isometrically.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: Dopamine in the concentration range of 10-9 M-10-7 M produced a mild relaxant effect on phenylephrine-precontracted ITA, and at higher concentrations than 10-7 M it produced a constrictor response. Ther relaxant effect of dopamine was partially antagonized by L-NAME (nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 10-6 M), propranolol (10-6 M), and cis-&alpha;-flupenthixol (dopaminergic receptor antagonist, 10-6 M), but not by metoclopramide (D2-dopaminergic receptor antagonist). The constrictor effect of dopamine was partially antagonized by phentolamine, prazosin and, yohimbine.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It was concluded that, while dopamine produces a vasodilator response at the lower concentrations, it causes a constrictor effect on ITA at the higher concentrations. Both a &beta;-adrenergic and a nitric oxide mediated mechanism (via D1-dopaminergic receptor) may play a role in the relaxant effect of dopamine on ITA at the lower concentrations. Constrictor response to dopamine at the higher concentrations on ITA may be produced by the activation of &alpha;1- and &alpha;2-adrenergic receptors.</span></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
