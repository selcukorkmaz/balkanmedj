Menopausal age and duration, HRT status, and daily dietary calcium intake of all patients were recorded. Evaluation of BMD was made with Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) from lumbar spine and femur and the T scores were obtained.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: There was a significant negative correlation between the patients&rsquo; age and duration of menopause, and BMD. The BMD values of the patients not receiving HRT were significantly lower than those of the patients receiving HRT. In women with dietary calcium intake above 1000 mg/day, spine and femur BMD values were significantly higher than in those with an intake below 600 mg/ day and between 600-1000 mg/day.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We think that dietary calcium intake and HRT status can be an indicator for BMD in postmenopausal women.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
