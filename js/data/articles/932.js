Venous blood samples were taken after 10 minutes sitting and after 10 minutes in supine position. Plasma ANP levels were measured by the ELISA method. Cardiac parameters were assessed by echocardiography.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: Plasma ANP levels in sitting position were higher in archery athletes (72.12&plusmn;14.01 pg/ ml) than sedentaries (36.22&plusmn;14.51 pg/ml; p&lt;0.01). Similarly, plasma ANP levels in supine position (124.41&plusmn;14.66 pg/ml) were significantly higher in the athletes than sedentaries (36.95&plusmn;9.83 pg/ml). Plasma ANP levels were higher in supine position than those in sitting position in archery athletes (p&lt;0.01). No significant increase in plasma ANP levels were found in supine position than sitting position in sedentary group. Echocardiographic parameters were similar in athletes and sedentary subjects.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is concluded that regular archery exercises without prominent functional and morphological alterations in the heart may cause differences in plasma ANP levels. Marked posture-related alterations may occur in plasma ANP levels of trained archery athletes.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
