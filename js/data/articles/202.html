	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a potentially fatal disease. Difficulties in diagnosis make it essential to find early biomarkers.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: This study investigated the diagnostic value of procalcitonin (PCT) levels in AMI.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Animal experimentation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Rats were divided into six groups of six animals each. In the experimental group, an experimental ischemia model was established by clamping the superior mesenteric artery from the aortic outflow tract. Blood and tissue specimens were collected from rats in the experimental mesenteric ischemia model at 30 min and 2 and 6 h, and these were compared with specimens from the respective control groups. PCT levels were compared at 30 min and 2 and 6 h.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: PCT levels were 185.3 pg/mL in the control group and 219.3 pg/mL in the study group, 199.6 pg/mL in the control group and 243.9 pg/mL in the study group, and 201.9 pg/mL in the control group and 286.9 pg/mL in the study group, respectively, at 30 minute, 2 and 6 hours. Significant differences were determined between 6-h control group and ischemia group PCT levels (p=0.005).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The absence of a significant increase in PCT levels in the early period, while a significant difference was detected in the later period (6 h), shows that PCT levels rise late in mesenteric ischemia and can be a marker in the late period.</p>
