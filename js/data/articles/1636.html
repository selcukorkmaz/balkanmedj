	<strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Intraabdominal adhesions remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Moreover, intraabdominal adhesions can develop in more than 50% of abdominal operations.<br />
	<strong>Aims</strong>: We compared the anti-adhesive effects of two different agents on postoperative adhesion formation in a cecal abrasion model.<br />
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Experimental animal study.<br />
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Forty Wistar albino type female rats were anesthetized and underwent laparotomy. Study groups comprised Sham, Control, Mitomycin-C, 4% Icodextrin, and Mitomycin-C +4% Icodextrin groups. Macroscopic and histopathological evaluations of adhesions were performed.<br />
	<strong>Results</strong>: The frequencies of moderate and severe adhesions were significantly higher in the control group than the other groups. The mitomycin-C and Mitomycin-C +4% Icodextrin groups were associated with significantly lower adhesion scores compared to the control group and 4% Icodextrin group scores (p=0.002 and p=0.008, respectively). The adhesion scores of the Mitomycin-C group were also significantly lower than those of the 4% Icodextrin group (p=0.008).<br />
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite its potential for bone marrow toxicity, Mitomycin-C seems to effectively prevent adhesions. Further studies that prove an acceptable safety profile relating to this promising anti-adhesive agent are required before moving into clinical trials.</p>
