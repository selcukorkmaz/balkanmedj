	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of transjugular liver biopsy in patients with contraindicated percutaneous biopsy.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Materials and Methods</strong>: Between June 2005 and April 2010, 97 patients who were admitted for transjugular liver biopsy were enrolled in this retrospective study. All liver biopsies were obtained using an 18 gauge Quick-Core liver biopsy set through the right hepatic vein via the internal jugular vein. Clinical indication, histopathological diagnosis, and complications were noted.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Primary technical success was achieved in 93 (95.8%) patients. Hepatic veins could not be catheterized and opacified in two patients and in the remaining two patients the veins could be opacified and catheterized but we were not able to pass the biopsy needle into the hepatic vein because of the acute angle between the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. At least two specimens were obtained from each patient. The most frequent histopathological diagnosis was cirrhosis. A subcutaneous hematoma around the puncture side was encountered in one patient.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Transjugular liver biopsy is a feasible and effective alternative in patients with contraindication for percutaneous biopsy.</p>
