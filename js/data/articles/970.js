In this study, it is aimed to compare the knowledge and attitudes of midwives and nurses about breastfeeding with breastfeeding practices of the mothers they provide counseling on baby feeding.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: The present study was carried out on 161 mothers having babies aged 12-18 months who lived in Edirne and on 59 midwives and nurses who had conducted their counseling and follow-up visits. Data were collected via two questionnaires prepared for the midwives and mothers.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: Midwives/nurses reported that they were visited by each mother for a mean of 6.5&plusmn;2.9 times during their pregnancy. Twenty-two of them had fed their babies only with breast milk for at least six months and 33 of them had suckled their babies for at least 12 months. Of the mothers, 65 had fed their babies only with breast milk for at least six months, while 82 had suckled their babies for at least 12 months.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study stresses the importance that nurses/midwives should enhance mothers&#39; consciousness for a successful breastfeeding. It is important that midwives should provide continuous support to mothers, which can be achieved by continuous professional training to midwives, nurses and other health staff regularly.</span></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
