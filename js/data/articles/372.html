	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Bilateral Wilms&rsquo; tumor is rare and surgical treatment requires an individual approach. Surgical approach to the tumors located in the central part of the kidney represents a major challenge and nephrectomy is usually essential. Renal sparing surgery is difficult in such cases.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report:</strong> We describe a 3 year-old female patient with bilateral Wilms&rsquo; tumor arising in the central localisation of the right and foci in the left kidney enucleated successfully with a simple and comfortable renal preserving operative technique using Focus Ultracision Harmonic Scalpel.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In cases when tumors are located in the central part of the kidney and partial nephrectomy is consequently very difficult, the use of a Focus Ultracision Harmonic Scalpel provides easy dissecting, enucleation, and excision of the tumor.</p>
