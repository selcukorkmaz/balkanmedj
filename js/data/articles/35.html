	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background:&nbsp;</strong>In recent days, synthetic cannabinoid derivatives have become life threatening for young people. Here, we want to share a case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia triggered by inhalation of synthetic cannabinoid, new side effects of which are being detected day by day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report:</strong>&nbsp;A 21-year-old male, who had no history of pulmonary diseases, was admitted to the clinic with shortness of breath. His oxygen saturation was measured as 85-86% in room air. Common irregular ground-glass opacities were observed in thorax radiology. His peripheral blood eosinophil count was 1100 cell/mm&sup3; with a leukocyte differential of 12%. Sputum eosinophilia was also observed. The patient was diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia in terms of current clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Rapid remission was achieved with corticosteroid therapy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion:</strong>&nbsp;This is the first reported case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia induced by synthetic cannabinoid inhalation.</p>
