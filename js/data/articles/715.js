The two groups were evaluated prospectively.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Thirty two infants were included in the study. According to the Sarnat&amp;Sarnat classification, 9 (28.1%), 14 (43.8%) and 9 infants (28.1%) were in stage 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Eight (25%) infants died. In the correlation evaluation of risk factors; lack of-follow-up at the antenatal period (r&sup2;=0.35) and having convulsions (r&sup2;=0.50) were positively associated with Sarnat stage. A positive relationship between Sarnat stage and the mortality rate was also determined (r&sup2;=0.57). CK-MB was strongly (r&sup2;=0.74), troponin-I moderately (r&sup2;=0.44), and pH weakly (r&sup2;=0.27) associated with mortality. In predicting mortality, the sensitivity and specificity for CK-MB was 100% and 91.6%, for Troponin I 100% and 70.8% and for pH 75% and 87.5%, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study demonstrates that in HIE, the relationship between the early period mortality rate and CK- MB values are strong, whereas for troponin-I and pH there is a moderate and weak association respectively.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
