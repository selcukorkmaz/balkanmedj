	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Background</strong>: Hemifacial spasm is a sudden, involuntary and synchronous spasm of the facial muscles. The most frequent cause of this condition is compression of the facial nerves due to vascular pathologies. The most commonly used method of treatment is Botulinum toxin injection. However, the gold standard treatment is surgical treatment.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: A 64-year-old male patient with hemifacial spasms, which had occurred due to a rare parotid mass that had been surgically treated, is presented in this case.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: This case report demonstrates that long-standing parotid gland masses may compress the facial nerves and cause demyelination in the nerve and thus may cause spasms in the facial muscles.</p>
