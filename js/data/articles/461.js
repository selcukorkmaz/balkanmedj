On December 2011, parents were questioned about the vaccination.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Influenza vaccination rate of the previous season (28.3%) increased to 50.0% (p&lt;0.05). Receiving the vaccine in 2010 was the only contributing factor to the recommendation success. The reasons given by the non-receivers were; forgetting (50.0%), fear of adverse-effects (26.4%), not believing in usefulness (15.2%), rejection by the child (4.2%) and effects of media (4.2%). 88.9% of those who forgot declared that they would receive if they were reminded at the beginning of the season.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The rate of influenza vaccination was low. The majority of those who didn&#39;t recieve the vaccination declared that they would if they were reminded at the beginning of the season and the fact that &ldquo;receiving the vaccine in 2010&rdquo; was the only factor influencing the recommendation success indicate that recommending isn&#39;t enough but that reminding and giving detailed information about the vaccine will increase vaccination rates independent of other factors.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
