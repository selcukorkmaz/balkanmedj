	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Meningiomas are generally benign central nervous system neoplasms, which frequently express progesterone receptor (PR) and rarely express the estrogen receptor (ER). The significance of Her-2/neu expression in meningiomas is unclear. We evaluated the correlation with Her-2/neu, PR, ER expressions and clinicopathologic parameters in World Health Organization (WHO) Grade I meningiomas.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: In total, 53 cases of meningiomas were included in this study. Formaline-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were immunostained for Her-2/neu, PR and ER.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: Whereas 27 (50.9%) of meningiomas were positive for PR, no reaction was determined for ER. Her-2/neu overexpression was observed in 12 (22.6%) cases. There was positive correlation between Her-2/ neu and PR expressions (p=0.015). Her-2/neu expression was frequently seen in meningothelial type (p=0.03). There were no correlations with Her-2/neu, ER, PR and other clinicopathologic parameters.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The results of our study show that despite there being PR expression at a high rate in grade I meningiomas, ER expression is a rare finding. Moreover, Her-2/neu expression has been detected more often in the PR positive and meningothelial type.</span></p>
