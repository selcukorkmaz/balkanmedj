	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: To explore the differences existing between the levels of oxidative stress in peripheral and mesenteric serum in patients with colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: One hundred fifty patients with colorectal cancer who underwent surgery between May 2005 and March 2010 were prospectively analyzed. The differences between oxidative stress parameters in their peripheral and mesenteric blood were measured. The associations between peripheral and mesenteric levels and the staging and clinicopathological variables were investigated.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Oxidative stress parameters were higher in patients with advanced tumor staging (p&lt;0.01), lymph node invasion (p&lt;0.01), and venous invasion (p&lt;0.01). Differences between oxidative stress parameters in peripheral and mesenteric blood samples were also observed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusions</strong>: The mesenteric levels of the oxidative stress markers were higher than the peripheral levels in these colorectal cancer patients. Higher levels of these oxidative stress markers are associated with an advanced state of cancer.</p>
