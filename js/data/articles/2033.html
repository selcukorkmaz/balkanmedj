												        						<p><strong>Background</strong>: Central nervous system tuberculosis remains a prevalent problem in developing countries. Also, this disease has been an important problem in developed countries due to the increased incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Tuberculosis of the central nervous system is seen in 10% of immunocompetent patients with primary tuberculosis.</p>
<p><strong>Case Report</strong>: We report two patients with tuberculoma in the central nervous system. The first case had a lesion located in the medulla oblongata, and the second case had a lesion in the medulla spinalis between the 5th cervical and 1st thoracic vertebral level. Both of these patients underwent surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: CNS tuberculomas may not always show typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs, but when a neurosurgeon encounters a brownyellow rubber-like lesion that is easily extirpated from the glial tissue, tuberculoma should be considered; anti-tuberculous and corticosteroid therapy should be initiated as soon as possible to prevent meningitis and the immune-mediated destructive effects of tuberculosis on the CNS. Whether or not anti-tuberculous therapy is continued can be decided upon by following definitive pathologic diagnosis.</p>												        					</div>
