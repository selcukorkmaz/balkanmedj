	<strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Congenital complete atrioventricular block without any structural heart disease and anti-Ro/La negativity is very rare. Discordant complete atrioventricular block, which is more frequently defined in the literature as an autoimmune mechanism, is much more rare in monozygotic twins.<br />
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: The 26-year-old healthy mother had given birth in her first spontaneous, uneventful pregnancy to monozygotic twins at week 35. While the first twin&rsquo;s physical examination proved her to be normal with a pulse rate consistent with her age, the second twin had a pulse rate of approximately 40 beats/minute.The patient was confirmed to have congenital complete atrioventricular block.<br />
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite this case appears to be an isolated one, a discordant complete atrioventricular block regression without any autoimmune evidence should be included in the differential diagnosis of bradycardia in infants.</p>
