	<strong>Background</strong>: Atopic dermatitis is the most common chronic inflammatory skin disease. A complex interaction of both genetic and environmental factors is thought to contribute to the disease.<br />
	<strong>Aims</strong>: To evaluate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms in the TLR2 gene c.2258C&gt;T (R753Q) (rs5743708) and TLR2 c.-148+1614T&gt;A (A-16934T) (rs4696480) (NM_0032643) are associated with atopic dermatitis in Turkish children.<br />
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case-control study.<br />
	<strong>Methods</strong>: The study was conducted on 70 Turkish children with atopic dermatitis aged 0.5-18 years. The clinical severity of atopic dermatitis was evaluated by the severity scoring of atopic dermatitis index. Serum total IgE levels, specific IgE antibodies to inhalant and food allergens were measured in both atopic dermatitis patients and controls, skin prick tests were done on 70 children with atopic dermatitis. Genotyping for TLR2 (R753Q and A-16934T) single nucleotide polymorphisms was performed in both atopic dermatitis patients and controls.<br />
	<strong>Results</strong>: Cytosine-cytosine and cytosin-thymine genotype frequencies of the TLR2 R753Q single nucleotide polymorphism in the atopic dermatitis group were determined as being 98.6% and 1.4%, cytosine allele frequency for TLR2 R753Q single nucleotide polymorphism was determined as 99.29% and the thymine allele frequency was 0.71%, thymine-thymine, thymine-adenine, and adenine-adenine genotype frequencies of the TLR2 A-16934T single nucleotide polymorphism were 24.3%, 44.3%, and 31.4%. The thymine allele frequency for the TLR2 A-16934T single nucleotide polymorphism in the atopic dermatitis group was 46.43%, and the adenine allele frequency was 53.57%, respectively. There was not statistically significant difference between the groups for all investigated polymorphisms (p&gt;0.05). For all single nucleotide polymorphisms studied, allelic distribution was analogous among atopic dermatitis patients and controls, and no significant statistical difference was observed. No homozygous carriers of the TLR2 R753Q single nucleotide polymorphism were found in the atopic dermatitis and control groups.<br />
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The TLR2 (R753Q and A-16934T) single nucleotide polymorphisms are not associated with atopic dermatitis in a group of Turkish patients.</p>
