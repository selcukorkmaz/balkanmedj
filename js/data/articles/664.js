Based on life tables, this study uses the Gini coefficient in measuring the extent of inequality in years lived and shows the level of these inequalities in Turkey for the period 1990-2008.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: Lorenz Curves were constructed by using data from life tables pertaining to years 1990, 2000, 2006 and 2008 as given by WHO database, Gini coefficients were calculated in measuring variability in length of life expectancies in general, for the male and female population and then used in examining reducing inequality over time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Taking 1990 as the base year, life expectancy at birth has increased by 9.3 years by 2008 and inequality has decreased from 0.188 to 0.114 (by 39%) in the same period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In addition to the target of increasing life expectancy, the assessment of success in ensuring all individuals live up to average life expectancy should be conducted by using this measure of inequality.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
