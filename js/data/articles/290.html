	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Inferior vena cava (IVC) oxygen saturation as an indicator of mixed venous oxygenation may be valuable for understanding postnatal adaptations in newborn infants. It is unknown how this parameter progresses in critically ill premature infants.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: To investigate IVC oxygen saturation during the first three days of life in preterm infants with and without patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case-control study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Twenty-seven preterm infants were admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care. Preterm infants with umbilical venous catheterization were included in the study. Six umbilical venous blood gas values were obtained from each infant during the first 72 hours of life. Preterm infants in the study were divided into two groups. Haemodynamically significant PDA was diagnosed by echocardiography in 11 (41%) infants before the 72nd hour of life in the study group and ibuprofen treatment was started, whereas 16 (59%) infants who didn&rsquo;t have haemodynamically significant PDA were included in the control group.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: In the entire group, the highest value of mean IVC oxygen saturation was 79.9% at the first measurement and the lowest was 64.8% at the 72nd hour. Inferior vena cava oxygen saturations were significantly different between the study and control groups. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the first and 36th hour measurements made the difference (p=0.01).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Inferior vena cava oxygen saturation was found to be significantly different between preterm infants with and without PDA. Further studies are needed to understand the effect of foetal shunts on venous oxygenation during postnatal adaptation in newborn infants.</p>
