	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of the present study was to examine the protective effect of quercetine (QE) against cadmium (Cd)-induced renal toxicity.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: A total of 24 male Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups: control, Cd-treated and Cd-treated with QE; each group containing 8 animals. The Cd-treated group was injected subcutaneously with CdCl2 dissolved in saline in the dose of 2 ml/kg/day for 30 days, resulting in a dosage of 1 mg/kg Cd. The rats in the QE treated groups were given QE (15 mg/kg body weight) once a day intraperitoneally starting 2 days prior to Cd injection during the study period.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The renal histology in Cd-treated rats showed mesangial expansion, thickening of capsular basement membranes, glomerular basement membranes and tubular basement membranes, characterized by an increase in periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive areas as compared with control animals. With the QE treatment, despite the presence of only a few swollen glomeruli, we noticed a marked protection of renal structure when compared with the Cd-treated rats. Furthermore, QE pretreatment resulted in increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunoreactivity and decreased the activity of Terminal Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: These findings suggest that QE may attenuate Cd-induced renal toxicity.</p>
