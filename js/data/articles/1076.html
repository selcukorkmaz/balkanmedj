	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: There are no published data regarding efficacy of tigecycline in brucellosis and in vitro data are scarce. We compared the in vitro activity of tigecycline to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampicin, tetracycline, streptomycin and ciprofloxacin against Brucella spp.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: In vitro activities of tigecycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampicin, tetracycline, streptomycin and ciprofloxacin were evaluated against 96 strains of Brucella spp. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by the E-test method.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Tigecycline had low MIC50 and MIC90 values against all Brucella isolates; the highest MIC observed was 0.19 &micro;g/mL.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Tigecycline had low MICs against Brucella spp. including tetracycline-resistant isolates and its use in therapy should be confirmed by clinical studies.</p>
