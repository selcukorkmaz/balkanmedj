												        						<p><strong>Background</strong>: Rho/ROCK signaling has been demonstrated to be&nbsp;involved in the vascular reactivity of many arterial networks.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;RhoA expression and the contribution of Rho/ROCK pathway to the&nbsp;control of perfusion pressure have not been investigated in the rat hind&nbsp;limb vascular bed as a skeletal muscle vascular network.<br /><strong>Aims</strong>: To investigate the contribution of the Rho/ROCK pathway in&nbsp;the control of perfusion pressure in the isolated-perfused rat hind limb&nbsp;vascular bed.<br /><strong>Study Design</strong>: Animal experimentation.<br /><strong>Methods</strong>: Two Rho inhibitors (atorvastatin and C3 exoenzyme) and&nbsp;ROCK inhibitors (Y-27632 and fasudil) were tested on the phenylephrine-elevated perfusion pressure in the isolated-perfused rat hind limb&nbsp;vascular bed. Furthermore, we sought the expression of RhoA protein&nbsp;in the femoral, popliteal and saphenous arteries as well as quadriceps&nbsp;and gastrocnemius muscles by Western blotting.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: The ROCK inhibitors Y-27632 and fasudil (both 10&minus;8 to 10&minus;5 M) induced substantial vasodilatations. The maximum vasodilatations induced by Y-27632 and fasudil (both at 10&minus;5 M) were 84.0 &plusmn; 6.9% and 76.9 &plusmn; 6.9%, respectively (P = .091). Y-27632 was not more potent than fasudil, as the EC50 values for Y-27632 and fasudil were 0.7 &plusmn; 2.1 &mu;M and 2.5 &plusmn; 2.4 &mu;M, respectively (P = .177). Atorvastatin (10&minus;7 to 10&minus;4 M) and C3 exoenzyme (3 &times; 10&minus;8 M) also produced vasodilatation (maximum vasodilatation; 20.3 &plusmn; 1.7% and 13.7 &plusmn; 3.6%, respectively). The EC50 value for atorvastatin was 94.9 &plusmn; 1.2 &mu;M. The western blot analysis showed that the femoral, saphenous, and popliteal arteries, as well as the gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscles, express RhoA protein.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The Rho/ROCK pathway contributes significantly to the&nbsp;control of perfusion pressure in the rat hind limb vascular bed.</p>												        					</div>
