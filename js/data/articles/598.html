	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens in hospitals, and the most frequent cause of nosocomial infections. Nosocomial staphylococcal foreign-body infections related to biofilm formation are a serious threat, demanding new therapeutic and preventive strategies. Implantation of intravenous catheters and surgical implantation of prosthetic implants carry a risk of infection. In order to prevent all these effects of biofilms, a study was designed to observe the possible antibacterial effect of sumach (Rhus coriaria) on the biofilm formation of S. aureus.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: The influence of varying concentrations of sumach on the formation of biofilms by 13 strains of Staphylococcus aureus was tested by a microelisa assay.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The significant differences between varying concentrations of sumach (0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 &mu;l/ml) were observed in four methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and nine methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (p&lt;0.05). In bacteria, a dose-related decrease in the formation of slime, which is a major virulence factor of staphylococcal infections, was observed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In our study, using 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 &mu;l/ml of sumach, thirteen strains lost, 17%, 22%, 28% and 48% respectively of their capacity to produce biofilms. Sumach, which is a herbal product, can decrease the formation of biofilm, which is a major virulence factor in staphylococcal infections.</p>
