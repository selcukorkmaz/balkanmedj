	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of this study was to compare size 2 Laryngeal Mask Airway ProSeal and size 2 Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme in spontaneously breathing children undergoing lower abdominal elective surgery of &lt;1 hour duration.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Randomized clinical trial.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Sixty children aged 1-7 years, weighing 10-20 kg, ASA I physical status were randomly allocated to the Laryngeal Mask Airway ProSeal and Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: There were no differences in demographic variables, ease of gastric tube placement, ease of insertion and ventilation, number of insertion attempts, hemodynamic changes on insertion, postoperative complications and bloodstaining between the groups. Gastric insufflation was detected and gastric tube was placed in all patients except one in LMA Supreme. Postoperative cuff volumes were comparable with the preoperative values in group itself. Oropharyngeal leak pressures were higher in Laryngeal Mask Airway ProSeal (24.6&plusmn;5.5 vs 21.3&plusmn;4.2, respectively; p&lt;0.01).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: As a result Laryngeal Mask Airway ProSeal and Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme can safely be used in spontaneously breathing pediatric population undergoing lower abdominal elective surgery.</p>
