Interleukin-28B (IL28B) single nucleotide polymorphisms may play an important role in the clearance of HCV spontaneously or with treatment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of our study was to evaluate the rate of IL28B genotypes in patients with Chronic Hepatitis-C (CHC) and healthy control subjects and to examine the characteristics of patients in each IL28B subgroup.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case-control study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: IL28B polymorphisms were genotyped by Polymerase Chain Reaction and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in all subjects.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The mean age was 52.3&plusmn;10.9 years (33% female) in the CHC patients and 52.5&plusmn;11.5 years (39.1% female) in the healthy controls. The percentage of patients with a high baseline viral load (&ge;400,000 IU/mL) was higher in the CT group (69.8%) compared to the C/C (44.4%) and T/T (50%) groups (p=0.021). There was no significant difference in liver fibrosis and liver necroinflammation distribution among the CC, CT and TT genotypes with mild, moderate and severe groups (p=0.058 and p=0.791, respectively). Mean age, gender ratio, body mass index, viral load at baseline, rate of HCV genotypes, baseline ALT levels were not significantly different among the three IL28B subgroups (p&gt;0.05). A significant increase was observed in the frequencies of IL28B rs12979860 TT genotypes in the CHC patients (20.6%) compared to the healthy control group (8.7%) (p=0.033).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In the patients with chronic HCV-genotype 1b and 4 infections, the IL28B rs12979860 (C&gt;T) gene polymorphism frequency of the TT genotype and T allele was higher than in healthy control subjects. This result indicates that the TT genotype may be more effective in the progression of HCV infection than other genotypes.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
