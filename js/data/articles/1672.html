	<strong>Background:</strong> Subcutaneous mastectomy for female- to-male transsexuals is usually the first surgical pro- cedure in sexual reassignment. The main objective of subcutaneous mastectomy is to create an aesthetically pleasing male chest contour by removing all glandular tissue while minimizing chest wall scars.<br />
	<strong>Aims:</strong> In this paper, we present our experience with subcutaneous mastectomy performed in female-to- male transsexual patients. The authors recommend their point of view to aid in selecting the most suitable subcutaneous mastectomy technique depending on breast characteristics.<br />
	<strong>Study Design: </strong>Retrospective cross-sectional study.<br />
	<strong>Methods: </strong>Between March 2011 and December 2014,<br />
	52 patients underwent bilateral subcutaneous mastec- tomies (total of 104 mastectomies), performed using the following four techniques: Webster semicircular, concentric circular, vertical, and apron flap. The tech- nique decision depended on the breast size, degree of skin excess, skin elasticity, chest width, nipple areolar complex size and position.<br />
	<strong>Results: </strong>Seventeen patients (32.7%) were operated with Webster semicircular, 7 patients (13.5%) with con- centric periareolar, 12 patients with vertical (23%); and 16 patients (30.8%) with the apron flap technique. The overall postoperative complication rate was 13.4%. All patients were satisfied with the aesthetic results of their subcutaneous mastectomies within the follow-up period.<br />
	<strong>Conclusion:</strong> To obtain higher patient satisfaction with aesthetic results and lower postoperative complication rates, breast characteristics are evaluated in a detailed fashion, while choosing the ideal technique of Female-to-Male (FtM) subcutaneous mastectomy. The presented surgical new algorithm facilitates the selection of the most reliable surgical technique.</p>
