	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a disease associated with episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and ventricular pre-excitation or atrial fibrillation. WPW is characterized by an aberrant electrical conduction pathway between atria and ventricles.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: The major anesthetic problem connected with WPW syndrome is the risk of tachyarrhythmias due to accessory pathway. Therefore, it has been proposed that the aim of anesthetic management should be the avoidance of tachyarrhythmia and sympathetic stimulation. Sugammadex was administered as a neuromuscular reversal agent in this case. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of sugammadex use in a patient with WPW. This report presents a case of general anesthesia management in a patient with WPW syndrome.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We think that it is appropriate to use sugammadex to reverse rocuronium for the prevention of sudden hemodynamic changes in patients with WPW who underwent general anesthesia.</p>
