The pain was retrosternal, pressure-like in character, provoked by moderate physical exertion, and relieved by rest, consistent with Canadian Cardiovascular Society class II angina pectoris. His medical history was unremarkable, and he had no conventional cardiovascular risk factors. He reported a history of contact with livestock, including sheep and cattle.</p>\n<p>Physical examination was unremarkable, with normal heart sounds and no murmurs. Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm with nonspecific T-wave changes in the lateral leads. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a well-circumscribed, round, cystic mass measuring 38 x 35 mm within the interventricular septum, extending toward the basal segment of the left ventricular free wall (Figure 1a). The cyst had a characteristic double-layered wall with an anechoic interior and contained no internal echoes, findings suggestive of a hydatid cyst. Left ventricular systolic function was preserved, with an ejection fraction of 60%.</p>\n<p>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest confirmed a hypodense, non-enhancing, oval intramyocardial lesion in the interventricular septum (Figure 1b). Critically, the mass was in close proximity to the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, with imaging suggesting extrinsic compression of the mid-LAD segment. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated the cyst with a low signal intensity rim on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity content on T2-weighted images, consistent with a viable hydatid cyst (Gharbi type I) (Figure 1c). Serological testing for Echinococcus granulosus was positive (indirect hemagglutination titer 1:1280). Abdominal ultrasonography and chest radiography revealed no additional cyst locations.</p>\n<p>The patient was initiated on preoperative albendazole therapy (400 mg twice daily) for 4 weeks. He subsequently underwent open cardiac surgery via median sternotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass. The cystic mass was carefully excised from the interventricular septum using a cystopericystectomy technique, with meticulous care to avoid intraoperative spillage of cyst contents. The operative field was protected with hypertonic saline-soaked sponges. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst, demonstrating the laminated membrane and protoscolices.</p>\n<p>The postoperative course was uneventful. Postoperative echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular function and no residual mass. The patient was continued on albendazole for 6 months. At 12-month follow-up, he was asymptomatic, exercise stress testing was negative, and cardiac MRI showed no evidence of recurrence.</p>\n<p>Cardiac involvement occurs in only 0.5-2% of all hydatid disease cases, with the left ventricle being the most commonly affected chamber. Cardiac hydatid cysts can present with a wide spectrum of symptoms depending on their location and size, ranging from chest pain and dyspnea to potentially fatal complications including cyst rupture with anaphylaxis, systemic embolization, and cardiac tamponade. Compression of coronary arteries, as in our case, is a rare but important mechanism of angina in patients from endemic regions. Surgical excision remains the treatment of choice for cardiac hydatid cysts, supplemented by perioperative antihelminthic therapy to prevent dissemination and recurrence.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol class=\"references-list\">\n<li>Dursun M, Terzibasioglu E, Yilmaz R, et al.
