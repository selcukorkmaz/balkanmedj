	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Sugammadex has been shown to decrease the efficiency of progesterone-containing oral contraceptive drugs which possess a steroid structure.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of sugammadex on progesterone levels in pregnant rats as well as on the physiological course of the pregnancy.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study</strong> <strong>Design</strong>: Animal experiment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: This study was approved by the Sel&ccedil;uk University Ethical Committee for Experimental Animal Research. Pregnant Winster Albino rats (n=26) were divided into three groups and administered with various intravenous injections on the 7th day of pregnancy. The control group (Group K, n=6) received 1.5 mL serum physiologic, the sugammadex group (Group S, n=10) received 30 mg/kg sugammadex and the sugammadex + rocuronium group (Group SR, n=10) received 30 mg/kg sugammadex and 3.5 mg/kg rocuronium. Progesterone levels were measured and the offspring were monitored for morphologic status.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Mean progesterone levels were 94.16&plusmn;15.54 ng/mL in Group K, 87.86&plusmn;12.48 ng/mL in Group S, and 94.53&plusmn;16.10 ng/mL in Group SR (p&gt;0.05). No stillbirth or miscarriage was observed in the rats. The mean number of offspring was 6.8&plusmn;1.47 in Group K, 6.5&plusmn;1.35 in Group S, and 6.4&plusmn;1.17 in Group SR. The offspring appeared macroscopically normal.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Sugammadex does not appear to affect the progesterone levels in pregnant rats in the first trimester and the clinical course. Successful completion of pregnancy and the absence of stillbirth or miscarriage will guide future studies about the use of sugammadex, particularly in the first trimester of the pregnancy.</p>
