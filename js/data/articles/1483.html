	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We investigated the morphologic changes showing hepatocellular damage caused by the chronic use of cisplatin, an antineoplastic agent, and the protective effect of vitamins E and C.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Twenty-four Wistar albino male rats were randomly assigned to four groups, equal in number, to receive intravenous 5 mg/kg of cisplatin once a month for three months except for the control rats (group 1). The rats in group 3 and 4 also received daily intramuscular injections of 5 mg/kg of vitamin E and 8 mg/kg of vitamin C, respectively. At the end of three months, the livers were removed for light and electron microscopic examinations.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Control rats showed a normal liver tissue structure. Group 2 rats exhibited disorganization of the Remak&#39;s fibers, thickening of the basement membrane together with dilatation of the sinusoids near the centrolobular vein, and lymphocyte infiltration in the portal areas. In vitamin E-treated rats, there was a significant decrease in morphological damage, with disappearance of lymphocyte infiltration in the portal areas. Vitamin C-treated rats manifested the least morphological damage, with a rare infiltration to portal areas and decreased number of infiltration cells.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings suggest that the use of antioxidants of different properties may help reduce cisplatin hepatotoxicity, thus contributing to clinical applications.</p>
