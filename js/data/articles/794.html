	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: To investigate the correlation of the grip strength with sonographic measurement of interosseous muscles (IM) and the intermetacarpal fat pads (IMFP) of the hand.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: A total of 40 healthy volunteers (mean age: 39&plusmn;12 years, all female) were examined. Hand strength was assessed by the Jamar hand dynamometer. IM and IMFP thickness and width for both hands (n:80) were measured sonographically at four levels (1th, 2nd, 3rd and 4th intermetacarpal; palmar side for IM) and at three levels (2nd, 3rd and 4th intermetacarpal; dorsal side for IMFP).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The mean grip strength was 40&plusmn;12 pounds (range: 20-67). Mean values (thickness x width) for IM were 20.7&plusmn;2.1&times;9.9&plusmn;1.2 mm, 9.0&plusmn;1&times;10.3&plusmn;0.9 mm, 7.3&plusmn;1.0&times;9.9&plusmn;1.0 mm, 8.5&plusmn;1&times;9.5&plusmn;0.9 mm at four levels, respectively. Mean values (thickness x width) for IMFP were 9.9&plusmn;1.2&times;5.3&plusmn;0.7 mm, 8.5&plusmn;0.9&times;5.4&plusmn;0.7 mm and 9.0&plusmn;1.2&times;4.7&plusmn;0.7 mm at three levels, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the grip strength and the dimensions of IM and IMFP (p&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusions</strong>: To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the correlation of grip strength and the sonographic IM-IMFP measurements. Further research in study groups affected by clinical situations involving the hand, is necessary to reveal the role of IM and IMFP studies in evaluating the pathologies.</p>
