	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The surgical treatment of nasal polyposis has occupied physicians since antiquity. Through the ages it has improved and with the introduction of endoscopic sinus surgery, the removal of nasal polyposis is accomplished with great precision. At the end of XX. century, this surgical technique was completed with the use of microdebriders, as in the endoscopic treatment of the joints in orthopedics. The aim of the study is to share our experience with the surgical treatment of nasal polyposis with powered equipment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Fifty four patients with nasal polyposis were operated with microdebriders. The patients were followed for a period of 1 year. The assessment included clinical examination and subjective and objective methods of measuring nasal breathing. The surgical technique, its advantages and precision are described.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Recurrence of the nasal polyposis was found in five patients.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusions</strong>: Minimal bleeding, clear operative field, reduced operative time and enhanced security of this method make it very convenient in everyday rhinological practice.</p>
