	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The impact of standardized patient feedback on the motivational levels of learners for learning communication skills was examined in the study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: Control group post-test design was used and 284 of Year-I students took part in the study (87%). Both groups were randomly organized. The students had two standardized patient encounters in addition to training and debriefing sessions. The study group students received face-to-face feedback after the first encounters; but not the control group. We used the motivation dimension of Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire and t-test to evaluate the differences between the average scores of motivational levels of both groups for all sub-dimensions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: After the first encounters, there is a significant difference between study and control groups in the sub-dimension of test anxiety (p=0.028). After the second encounters, the students of the study group who received feedback after the first encounters, got lower scores in the sub-dimension of test anxiety (p=0.016), and got higher scores in the subdimension of self-efficacy (p=0.027).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We found out that the students who received feedback had lower levels of test anxiety, and higher levels of self-efficacy. Those results showed that standardized patient feedback eafected student motivational levels in two sub-dimensions.</p>
