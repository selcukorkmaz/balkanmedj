We aimed to investigate the effects of erythropoietin (EPO) and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) on MTX-induced lung injury in rats.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Animal experiment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Twenty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups. Sham group, 0.3 mL saline; MTX group, 5 mg/kg MTX; EPO group, 5mg/kg MTX and 2000 IU/kg EPO; NAC group, 5 mg/kg MTX and 200 mg/kg NAC were administered once daily for 4 consecutive days. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and inflammation and congestion scores in lung tissues were evaluated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: In MTX group MDA were significantly higher, CAT and SOD were significantly lower than in sham, EPO and NAC groups (p&lt;0.005). In EPO group MDA, CAT, and SOD were higher, but not significant than those in group NAC (p&gt;0.005). In group MTX both scores were significantly higher than in sham (p&lt;0.005). The congestion score of group MTX was significantly higher than those of group EPO and NAC (p&lt;0.005).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: EPO and NAC have significant preventive effects on MTX-induced lung injury in rats. Decreased antioxidant capacity and increased MDA level may cause the oxidative damage in MTX group. Also, higher antioxidant capacity and lower MDA level may be a response to oxidative stress in EPO and NAC groups.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
