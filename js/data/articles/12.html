	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: The correlation of S100A8/S100A9 with various inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune diseases have been reported. There is no study investigating the levels of S100A8/S100A9 in autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD)</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: We aimed to evaluate the level of serum S100A8/S100A9 in AITD.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design:</strong>&nbsp;Case control study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods:&nbsp;</strong>Fifty patients with AITD (25 Hashimoto&rsquo;s thyroiditis (HT) and 25 Graves&rsquo; disease (GD)) were included in the study. Twenty seven healthy subjects participated as a control group. Blood samples were obtained in the 3 months after the initiation of medical treatment. Serum levels of total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidative status (TOS), total free sulfhydryl (SH), lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) and S100A8/S100A9 were analyzed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results:</strong>&nbsp;The patients with AITD had significantly higher S100A8/S100A9, OSI, LOOH and TOS levels than the healthy control group. There was no significant difference between GD and HT patients in terms of S100A8/S100A9, TOS and OSI levels. S100A8/S100A9 level was positively correlated with LOOH, TOS and OSI levels but negatively correlated with &ndash;SH level in the patients with AITD.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion:</strong>&nbsp;Serum S100A8/S100A9 levels were increased in patients with AITD and positively correlated with LOOH, TOS and OSI whereas negatively correlated with SH.</p>
