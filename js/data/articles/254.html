	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is an episodic and progressive inflammatory disease of the cartilaginous structures, including elastic cartilage of the ear and nose, hyaline cartilage of the peripheral joints, fibrocartilage at axial sites, and cartilage of the tracheobronchial tree. The spectrum of its presentations may vary from intermittent mild episodes of chondritis to occasional organ involvement or even life-threatening manifestations.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: We presented a 64 year-old male patient with bilaterally knee arthritis and discoloration of pinna.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is lack of awareness about this disease due to its rarity. With this case presentation, our goal was to draw attention to this disease, which could be delayed for the diagnosis.</p>												        					</div>
