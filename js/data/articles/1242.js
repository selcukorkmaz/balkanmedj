This study retrospectively reviewed medical records of four patients who underwent urgent surgery due to intraperitoneal rupture and the records of all patients treated for hepatic hydatidosis in the same period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Medical records of the 44 patients (24 females, 20 males; mean age 47.5 years; range 16 to 83 years) who were treated in our clinic for hepatic hydatidosis between January 2004 and June 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were evaluated with respect to age, sex, location of the cyst, surgical method applied, hospital stay duration, pre- and postoperative complications, and treatment methods applied for the complications.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results:Four </strong>patients (9%) underwent emergency surgery due to intraperitoneal rupture. Postoperative biliary leakage into the cyst cavity was observed in 15 patients (34%). It was closed spontaneously in 6 patients (40%) without further intervention. In 8 patients (53%) the biliary leakage continued for about 10 days and the daily median drainage was over 100 cc. Endoscopic sphincterotomy was performed in these cases. Mortality rate was 4% (n=2).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Rupture of hydatid cyst should be suspected in trauma patients who had hepatic cyst and intraperitoneal free fluid concomitantly. In these patients therapeutic intervention should be quick because of the risk of any anaflactic reaction. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is an effective treatment method for biliary fistula after hydatid cyst surgery.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
