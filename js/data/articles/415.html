	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of IgG antibodies against mumps in a representative stratified sample of children under 18 years of age in Pleven district, Bulgaria.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Cross sectional study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Materials and Methods</strong>: A cross-sectional, sero-epidemiologic survey of 132 children aged under 18 years was conducted in Pleven district. They were distributed into two age groups: from 0 to 11 years old (n=80) and from 12 to 18 years old (n=52). An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) was performed for indirect evidence of specific IgG antibodies in the serum.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The results showed that 41% of the investigated children were negative in terms of mumps IgG antibodies, 11% had borderline values and the remaining, approximately 48%, were positive. In the group of children aged 0 to 11 years who had received one dose of the mumps vaccine, 50% were negative for mumps IgG antibodies. In the second group of children aged 12 to 18 years who had received two vaccine doses, the percentage of participants negative for mumps IgG antibodies decreased significantly.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our observations emphasise the need to conduct expanded sero-epidemiological investigations of the populations most affected by mumps and to immunise susceptible individuals.</p>
