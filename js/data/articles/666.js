The aim of this study is to detect the sensitivity and specificity of CRP, IL-6 and D-dimer and identify their role in predicting adverse cardiac events.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: All patients describing typical chest pain were enrolled in the study. Demographic features and final diagnosis were written and serum specimens were collected. All patients were telephoned after one month to determine if there were any adverse cardiac events.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: There were 132 patients, (94 male, 38 female). The mean age was 60.92&plusmn;10.78. 55 patients were diagnosed as AMI (37 STEMI and 18 NSTEMI) 60 patients as unstable angina pectoris, 15 patients as stable angina pectoris and 2 patients as non cardiac chest pain. 6 patients died in the hospital. 15 patients had adverse cardiac events (12 recurrent AMI, 2 sudden cardiac death, 1 stroke). The levels of D-dimer, CRP and IL-6 at the presentation were not predictive for adverse events.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: D-dimer, CRP and IL-6 levels were high both in ACS and stable angina. Detecting the predictive value for adverse cardiac events requires larger patient numbers and longer follow up times.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
