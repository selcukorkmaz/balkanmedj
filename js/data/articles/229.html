	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Glanzmann Thrombasthenia (GT) is a genetic platelet dysfunction and a life threatening disease. Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS) is a topical hemostatic agent of herbal origin which has been recently made available for clinical use. Its hemostatic effect is independent from blood clotting factors and occurs as a result of the aggregation of focal red blood cells by an encapsulated protein web.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: In this paper, a patient with GT is presented in whom 3 months of gastrointestinal bleeding refractory to all medical therapies was controlled within a short time of using oral ABS.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The difference between this patient and other cases presented in the medical literature is the oral use of ABS. Thus, this patient may contribute to the medical community in showing the safety and efficacy of systemic (oral) ABS in patients with disorders of coagulation. However, there is a need for more patient experiences.</p>
