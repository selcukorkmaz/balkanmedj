	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We presented our efforts to develop a student feedback questionnaire to be used in the assessment of performance and efficiency of lecturers and academicians in our faculty and evaluated the results of a pilot implementation of the questionnaire.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: A question pool was created at a meeting discussion of lecturers and academicians of the Department of Medicine Education. Thereafter, the questions were grouped and priority fields of data to be formulated in the items were determined. Finally, a 17-item questionnaire was administered to the students during a lecture. A five-item Likert scale was used to evaluate the responses.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The internal reliability of the pilot scale (Cronbach alpha) was found as 0.8758 for 101 respondents.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The questionnaire was found eligible for the use of obtaining students&#39; feedback on performance and efficiency of lecturers.</p>
