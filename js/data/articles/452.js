Induction of anesthesia was performed with propofol 2-2.5 mg/kg, rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 &mu;g/kg i.v. Sevoflurane 2% with an N2O/O2 mixture (FiO2: 35%) was used for maintenance. Tramadol 0.5 mg/kg (Group T: n=20), levobupivacaine 0.25% (Group L: n=20) and lidocaine 1% (Group C: n=20) in a 1/200,000 adrenaline solution was infiltrated into the surgical area 10 min before the operation (5 mL for ESS and 10 mL for SRP). All patients received fentanyl (bolus dose: 15 &mu;g and lockout interval: 10 min) with a patient-controlled analgesia device during the postoperative period. Pain was assessed using an 11-point visual analogue scale (VAS) every 4 h for the first 24 h. Analgesic requirements, opioid consumption and side effects in the postoperative period were recorded.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: There was a statistically significant decrease in postoperative fentanyl demand and consumption in patients receiving tramadol. Fentanyl doses in the 24 h period were 345.2&plusmn;168.8 &mu;g, 221.1&plusmn;120.6 &mu;g and 184.1&plusmn;130.3 &mu;g (p=0.002) for the Groups C, L and T, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in fentanyl requirements between the tramadol and control groups at the 16, 20 and 24 h time points (p=0.012, p=0.004 and p=0.002, respectively). The side effect profiles were similar.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusions</strong>: Our study indicates that the preemptive tramadol infiltration technique is an efficient, practical and safe alternative to levobupivacaine in ESS or SRP operations.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
