	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	A 28-year-old pregnant woman presented with positive rubella IgM and IgG antibodies at initial admission and at the 11th, 13th, 30th and 36th weeks of gestation. Rubella avidity test revealed high titers and the patient was followed-up to ensure birth of a healthy infant. Rubella infection may be asymptomatic and re-infection may demonstrate a subclinical course. It is easy to make the diagnosis of rubella by following the antibody titers during pregnancy. The critical point in such patients is to differentiate the condition of disease at admission and decide accordingly. Avidity test may be a useful method for the management of such patients.</p>
