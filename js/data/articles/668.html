	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: As environmental factors, the role of Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus infections in the development of tic and obsessive compulsive disorders (OCD) is controversial. The autoimmune hypothesis states that during infection, formation of autoantibodies leads to an autoimmune disorder, which in turn results in movement disorders, tic disorders and/or OCD. In order to test this hypothesis, we assayed these antibodies in children and adolescents diagnosed with tic disorders and/or OCD.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: Children and adolescents who were diagnosed with either tic disorders or OCD according to DSM-IV criteria (n=28), were compared with healthy controls (n=15) having similar age and gender characteristics. Regardless of a streptococcus infection history, serum samples of all patients and controls underwent antinuclear, cytoskeletal, and antineuronal antibody assay using indirect immunofluorescence.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The rates of antinuclear antibody positivity were 21% and 20% in the patient and control groups respectively (p&gt;0.05). Antineuronal antibody was positive in 2 (7%) of 28 patients versus in 1 (6%) of 15 controls (p&gt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results suggest that such antibodies may not be involved in the pathogenesis of tic disorders/OCD.</p>
