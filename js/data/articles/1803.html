												        						<p>At the end of the last year, we, editorial team, decided to redesign our website to better serve our readers, reviewers and authors. After much hard work, we are excited to officially announce the new and improved Balkan Medical Journal website. You can now reach us at <a href="javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_1803_0.jpg', 640, 480)"><b>http://balkanmedicaljournal.org/</b></a><br /><br />
We thought that it was important to renew the website to reach a wider audience. So, we wanted to have good, clear, easy-to-follow navigation throughout our website. The new website will remain both open access and free of article processing charges. We hope that the website will respond better to our readers" needs and interests.<br /><br />
Key features of the new website include: <br /><br />
