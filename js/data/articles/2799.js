The configuration of the umbilicoportal anastomosis may influence MPV blood flow and potentially affect fetal liver perfusion in fetuses with fetal growth restriction (FGR).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Aims:</strong> To evaluate absolute and normalized UV and MPV blood flows in fetuses with normal growth and FGR, and to investigate the effect of umbilicoportal anastomosis type on MPV flow.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Study Design:</strong> This prospective case&ndash;control study included 108 appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) fetuses and 43 FGR fetuses between 18 and 37 weeks of gestation, evaluated over nine months.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Methods:</strong> Ultrasound was used to measure UV and MPV diameters, while Doppler ultrasound assessed time-averaged maximum velocities. Flow volumes were calculated as time-averaged maximum velocity volume and normalized to estimated fetal weight (TAMXVVN) and abdominal circumference. Anastomoses were categorized as T-, X-, or H-shaped. Z-scores were derived from AGA nomograms.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Results:</strong> Compared with AGA fetuses, FGR fetuses exhibited significantly smaller UV diameters, lower absolute UV flow, UV-TAMXVVN, and UV-TAMXVV/AC (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05), but higher MPV-TAMXVVN (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05), suggesting compensatory redistribution. Both UV and MPV flows showed strong correlations with gestational age (r &gt; 0.7, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001). UV-TAMXVVN Z-scores decreased with gestation, whereas MPV-TAMXVVN Z-scores increased until 32 weeks before plateauing. Blood flow parameters did not differ significantly across anastomosis types in either group.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> FGR fetuses demonstrate reduced UV perfusion with compensatory increases in MPV flow. The type of umbilicoportal anastomosis does not significantly affect MPV blood flow.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
