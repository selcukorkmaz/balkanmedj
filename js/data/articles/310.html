	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Pelvic organ prolapse is an important problem for women. To overcome this issue, different operational technics are in use, such as abdominal sacrocolpopexy, sacrospinous fixation, and the total Prolift procedure.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: This study assessed perioperative complications in abdominal sacrocolpopexy, sacrospinous fixation, and the total Prolift procedure.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Retrospective comparative study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Perioperative complications were defined as any complication occurring during surgery or the first 6 weeks postoperatively. Forty-five patients underwent abdominal procedures, 60 patients underwent sacrospinous fixation, and 43 patients underwent the total Prolift procedure.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: In the abdominal group, one bladder injury, four hemorrhages, and three wound dehiscences occurred. In the sacrospinous group, one rectal injury and one postoperative vault infection occurred. In the Prolift group, one bladder injury and one hemorrhage occurred. Minor complications were more frequent in the abdominal group than the others. The operating time and hospital stay of the abdominal group were significantly longer than the others. The Prolift procedure had less operating time and hospital stay than other procedures.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The total Prolift may be a novel alternative for apical prolapse with low perioperative morbidities and complications.</p>
