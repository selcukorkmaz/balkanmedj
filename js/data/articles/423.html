	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of the study was to determine the effect of massage to the sacral region after cesarean delivery instead of employing a urinary catheter for the prevention of urinary retention.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Cross sectional study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: This interventional study population consisted of 60 women who were divided into two intervention groups and one control group. For the first intervention group, the sacral region was massaged every hour 10-15 minutes after cesarean delivery and every 30 minutes after a voiding sensation for the second intervention group. No interventions were made in the control group, although routine hospital services were provided. Socio-demographic data were collected using a questionnaire developed by the researchers. Other data were collected via observation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Fifteen percent (15%) of the women in the first intervention group needed to void 2 hours after cesarean delivery, 35% after 3 hours, and the mean time to void after delivery was 3.4&plusmn;0.8 hours. Forty percent (40%) of the women in the second intervention group needed to void after 5 hours, and the mean time to void after delivery was 5.5&plusmn;0.8 hours. Sixty percent (60%) of the women in the control group needed to void 6 hours later, and the mean time to void after delivery was 6.2&plusmn;0.7 hours. Urinary retention was not observed in the first intervention group. Our statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the three groups in terms of mean times to void after cesarean delivery (p&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In order to facilitate voiding and to prevent urinary retention, which is seen as a post-cesarean complication, massaging the sacral region could be recommended instead of urinary catheter insertion. Additional studies with larger groups are also recommended.</p>
