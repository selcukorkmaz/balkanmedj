	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Salivary gland stones most frequently arise from the submandibular salivary gland. A giant stone is not common, since its diagnosis and treatment is usually performed before the lesion becomes enlarged. A male patient referred to our clinic with complaints of painful neck swelling, trismus and dysphasia. The patient was hospitalized with the diagnosis of deep neck infection, and antibiotherapy was initiated. Computerized tomographic evaluation showed an opacity in the first neck region. The patient was operated on under general anesthesia, and the cause of the opacity was a sialolith that reached dimensions of4x2x1.5 cm, leading to extreme dilatation of Wharton&#39;s duct.</p>
