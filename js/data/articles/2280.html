												        						<p><strong>Background:</strong> Bevacizumab-combined chemotherapy is a new regimen for advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer.<br /><strong>Aims:</strong> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab-combined chemotherapy in advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer.<br /><strong>Study design:</strong> Systematic review and meta-analysis.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> Eligible studies were retrieved from Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. The data of primary outcomes including progression-free survival and overall survival and secondary outcomes including overall survival, response rate, and adverse events (grade &ge;2) were extracted, pooled, and used for the meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab-combined chemotherapy with other treatments in patients with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Notably, 2 randomized-controlled and 5 single-arm trials of bevacizumab-combined chemotherapy or bevacizumab single-agent therapy for endometrial cancer were included. Meta-analysis indicated that bevacizumab-combined chemotherapy significantly increased the progression-free survival rate (hazard ratio=0.82, 95% confidence interval=0.70, 0.97) and overall survival rate (hazard ratio=0.83, 95% confidence interval=0.70, 0.98) compared with chemotherapy alone. The rates of overall, complete, and partial response to bevacizumab-combined chemotherapy were 76%, 22%, and 21%, respectively. The 6 and 12-month disease-free progression rates after bevacizumab-combined chemotherapy were 79% and 62%, respectively. Anemia (23%), leukopenia (46%), neutropenia (51%), hypertension (16%), and fatigue (24%) were the general adverse events after bevacizumab-combined chemotherapy.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Bevacizumab-combined chemotherapy may have a higher efficacy in improving the overall and progression-free survival in patients with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancers compared with chemotherapy alone.</p>												        					</div>
