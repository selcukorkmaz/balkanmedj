	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Small intestinal biopsy remains the gold standard in diagnosing celiac disease (CD); however, the wide spectrum of histopathological states and differential diagnosis of CD is still a diagnostic problem for pathologists. Recently, Ensari reviewed the literature and proposed an update of the histopathological diagnosis and classification for CD.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Materials and Methods</strong>: In this study, the histopathological materials of 54 children in whom CD was diagnosed at our hospital were reviewed to compare the previous Marsh and Modified Marsh-Oberhuber classifications with this new proposal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: In this study, we show that the Ensari classification is as accurate as the Marsh and Modified Marsh classifications in describing the consecutive states of mucosal damage seen in CD.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusions</strong>: Ensari&rsquo;s classification is simple, practical and facilitative in diagnosing and subtyping of mucosal pathology of CD</p>
