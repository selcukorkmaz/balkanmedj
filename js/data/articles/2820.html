<h3>Editorial</h3>
<p>Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with recurrent stroke representing a particularly devastating complication that affects approximately 25% of survivors within five years of the initial event. Anticoagulation therapy has long been a cornerstone of secondary stroke prevention, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation and other cardioembolic etiologies. However, the use of conventional anticoagulants, including vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants targeting factor Xa or thrombin, is inherently constrained by an elevated risk of hemorrhagic complications, most critically intracranial hemorrhage. This fundamental limitation has driven intensive research into novel antithrombotic strategies that might decouple the antithrombotic efficacy from the bleeding liability of existing agents.</p>
<p>Factor XI and its activated form, factor XIa, have emerged as particularly attractive therapeutic targets in this context. Factor XI occupies a unique position in the coagulation cascade, functioning primarily in the amplification phase of thrombin generation rather than in the initiation phase. Epidemiological observations have consistently demonstrated that individuals with congenital factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C) experience a markedly lower incidence of ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolism compared with the general population, yet rarely exhibit spontaneous bleeding. This clinical phenotype suggests that factor XI contributes substantially to pathological thrombus formation while playing a relatively minor role in physiological hemostasis, a concept that has been supported by extensive preclinical data in animal models of arterial and venous thrombosis.</p>
<p>Several factor XI/XIa inhibitors are currently in advanced clinical development, representing diverse pharmacological approaches including antisense oligonucleotides, monoclonal antibodies, and small-molecule inhibitors. The PACIFIC-Stroke trial evaluated the antisense oligonucleotide IONIS-FXIRx (fesomersen) in patients with recent non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke, demonstrating dose-dependent reductions in factor XI activity with a favorable safety profile. The AXIOMATIC-SSP trial investigated the small-molecule factor XIa inhibitor milvexian in a similar population, revealing promising signals for stroke risk reduction without significant increases in major bleeding events. More recently, the phase III LIBREXIA-STROKE trial with milvexian and the OCEANIC-STROKE trial with the monoclonal antibody abelacimab have been initiated, enrolling thousands of patients and representing the most definitive evaluations of this therapeutic class to date.</p>
<p>The potential advantages of factor XI/XIa inhibition extend beyond the favorable bleeding profile. Unlike direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors, which require dose adjustments in patients with renal impairment and have well-documented drug-food interactions, several factor XI-targeted agents may offer more predictable pharmacokinetics and reduced susceptibility to clinically significant interactions. Furthermore, the long half-life of certain antibody-based approaches could enable monthly subcutaneous dosing, potentially improving treatment adherence compared with daily oral anticoagulants, a consideration of particular relevance in stroke patients who frequently contend with polypharmacy and cognitive impairment.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, important questions remain. The optimal timing of treatment initiation following acute ischemic stroke, the comparative efficacy across different stroke subtypes, and the long-term safety of sustained factor XI suppression require further elucidation. The observation that factor XI deficiency is associated with increased bleeding during surgical procedures involving tissues with high fibrinolytic activity, such as the oral cavity and urogenital tract, warrants careful monitoring in clinical trials. Additionally, the heterogeneity of the stroke population, encompassing large-artery atherosclerosis, small-vessel disease, and embolic stroke of undetermined source, may necessitate stratified analyses to identify patient subgroups most likely to benefit from this novel therapeutic approach.</p>
<p>Factor XI/XIa inhibitors represent a paradigm shift in antithrombotic therapy, offering the tantalizing prospect of effective thromboprophylaxis with minimal hemorrhagic risk. As the results of ongoing phase III trials become available, the stroke community eagerly anticipates whether this promise will translate into clinical practice, potentially transforming the landscape of secondary stroke prevention.</p>
