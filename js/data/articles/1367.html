<p>
	A case of duodenal necrosis during nasogastric tube feeding in a 45-year-old male patient hospitalized in intensive care unit with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome is reported with a review of literature. Abdominal distension developed after several days of uneventful nasogastric tube feeding. At laparotomy patchy necrosis of the duedonum was found without signs of bowel obstruction or impaired mesenteric perfusion. In this case, the large doses of fentanyl, midazolam and dopamine given for sedation, were suspected to be a major contributing factor to the development of the necrosis by impairing mucosal perfusion.</p>
