Patients were grouped according to the duration and current status of estrogen therapy and the effects of these variables on BMD were analysed. Bone mineral densities of lumbar spine, femur, trochanter, and Ward&#39;s triangle sites were measured by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Bone mineral densities of trochanter, and Ward&#39;s triangle sites of postmenopausal women who received HRT for more than 3 years were found to be significantly higher than those women who were treated for less than 3 years. Vertebral bone densities were significantly higher in postmenopausal women who received HRT for more than 3 years, compared to those women who were never treated with HRT. Ward&#39;s triangle and vertebral bone densities were significantly higher in postmenopausal women who received HRT for more than 3 years and those currently on HRT, compared to those women who never received HRT. BMD values of women who started but interrupted their HRTs, were similar to the values found in women who never received HRT. Increasing parity and duration of menopause were the factors that reduced BMD values.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It appeared that BMD of hip and spine increased in postmenopausal women after the third or more years on HRT and during the period of treatment with HRT. Parity and duration of menopause were identified as factors which increase the risk of osteoporosis.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
