<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Carotid atherosclerosis is a progressive vascular disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids, inflammatory cells, and fibrous tissue within the arterial wall, leading to plaque formation and luminal narrowing. It represents one of the principal causes of ischemic stroke, accounting for approximately 15-20% of all cerebrovascular events, and is strongly associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and vascular death. The global burden of carotid atherosclerosis continues to rise, driven by aging populations and the increasing prevalence of metabolic risk factors including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and smoking.</p>
<p>The pathogenesis of carotid atherosclerosis is a complex process involving multiple cell types, signaling pathways, and immune-mediated mechanisms. Endothelial dysfunction initiates the atherosclerotic cascade, promoting the recruitment of monocytes, which differentiate into macrophages and subsequently transform into lipid-laden foam cells. Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation contribute to fibrous cap formation, while the balance between plaque stabilizing and destabilizing forces ultimately determines the risk of plaque rupture and thromboembolism. Despite substantial advances in understanding these processes, the cellular heterogeneity within atherosclerotic plaques has remained incompletely characterized until the advent of single-cell technologies.</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of tissue biology by enabling transcriptomic profiling at individual cell resolution. This technology allows the identification of previously unrecognized cellular subpopulations, transitional cell states, and intercellular communication networks that are obscured in bulk transcriptomic analyses. Spatial transcriptomics further complements scRNA-seq by preserving the spatial context of gene expression, enabling the mapping of transcriptomic signatures to specific anatomical regions within tissues. Together, these approaches provide an unprecedented opportunity to dissect the cellular and molecular landscape of carotid atherosclerotic plaques.</p>
<p>Molecular docking, a computational technique for predicting the preferred orientation of a ligand when bound to a target protein, has emerged as a valuable tool in drug discovery and repurposing. By integrating molecular docking with single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data, it becomes possible to identify potential therapeutic targets and evaluate candidate compounds in a more biologically informed manner. In the present study, we performed an integrated analysis combining single-cell sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and molecular docking to dissect the cellular subpopulations in carotid atherosclerosis, characterize intercellular communication networks, and identify potential therapeutic targets and candidate compounds for this prevalent vascular disease.</p>

<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>

<h4>Data Collection</h4>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing data from carotid atherosclerotic plaques were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (accession number GSE159677). The dataset comprised samples from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis, including both atherosclerotic plaque tissue and adjacent macroscopically normal arterial wall. Clinical and demographic information, including age, sex, symptom status, and degree of stenosis, were obtained from the associated metadata. Spatial transcriptomics data were obtained from the GEO database (accession number GSE199425), encompassing Visium spatial gene expression profiles from sections of human carotid atherosclerotic plaques. All data were publicly available and had been collected under institutional review board approval as described in the original publications.</p>

<h4>Single-Cell Sequencing Analysis</h4>
<p>Raw scRNA-seq data were processed using the Cell Ranger pipeline (version 6.1.2, 10x Genomics) with alignment to the human reference genome (GRCh38). Quality control was performed using the Seurat R package (version 4.3.0). Cells with fewer than 200 or more than 5,000 detected genes, cells with more than 15% mitochondrial gene content, and potential doublets identified by DoubletFinder were excluded. Following quality control, data were normalized using the SCTransform method, and the top 3,000 highly variable genes were selected for downstream analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed, and the first 30 principal components were used for graph-based clustering using the Louvain algorithm at a resolution of 0.8. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) was employed for dimensionality reduction and visualization.</p>
<p>Cell type annotation was performed using a combination of canonical marker gene expression, reference-based annotation using SingleR with the Human Primary Cell Atlas as reference, and manual curation based on published literature. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each cluster were identified using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed on the DEGs using the clusterProfiler R package. Pseudotime trajectory analysis was conducted using Monocle3 to infer cellular differentiation trajectories and identify transitional cell states.</p>

<h4>Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis</h4>
<p>Spatial transcriptomics data were processed using the Space Ranger pipeline (version 1.3.1, 10x Genomics) and analyzed using the Seurat package with spatial analysis extensions. Quality control included filtering spots with fewer than 200 detected genes. Data were normalized using SCTransform, and spatially variable features were identified using the Moran's I statistic. Integration of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data was performed using the anchor-based integration method in Seurat, enabling deconvolution of cell type compositions at each spatial location. Spatial expression patterns of key genes identified from the single-cell analysis were visualized and correlated with histological features.</p>

<h4>Molecular Docking</h4>
<p>Protein structures for the identified therapeutic targets were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or predicted using AlphaFold2 when experimental structures were unavailable. Structures were prepared using AutoDock Tools (version 1.5.7), including removal of water molecules, addition of hydrogen atoms, and assignment of Gasteiger charges. A library of candidate compounds, including approved drugs and natural products with known anti-inflammatory or cardiovascular properties, was obtained from the DrugBank and ZINC databases. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock Vina with an exhaustiveness parameter of 32. Binding affinity was quantified as the predicted binding free energy (kcal/mol), and interactions were visualized using PyMOL and PLIP (Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler). Compounds with binding affinities stronger than -7.0 kcal/mol were considered as having strong binding potential.</p>

<h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 4.2.1). Continuous variables were compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Correlation analyses were performed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Multiple testing correction was applied using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to control the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<h4>Cellular Subpopulations</h4>
<p>After stringent quality control filtering, a total of 38,452 high-quality single cells were retained for downstream analysis. UMAP dimensionality reduction and graph-based clustering identified 15 distinct cell clusters, which were annotated into 8 major cell types: macrophages (28.3%), smooth muscle cells (SMCs, 22.1%), T cells (18.7%), endothelial cells (12.4%), B cells (6.8%), fibroblasts (5.2%), dendritic cells (4.1%), and mast cells (2.4%). Within the macrophage population, subclustering revealed four distinct subpopulations: resident-like macrophages expressing LYVE1 and FOLR2, inflammatory macrophages expressing IL1B and TNF, lipid-associated macrophages (foam cells) expressing TREM2 and GPNMB, and a previously uncharacterized transitional population co-expressing markers of both inflammatory and resident phenotypes.</p>
<p>Smooth muscle cells similarly exhibited substantial heterogeneity, with three subclusters identified: contractile SMCs expressing ACTA2, MYH11, and CNN1; synthetic/modulated SMCs expressing COL1A1, FN1, and LGALS3; and a macrophage-like SMC population expressing both canonical SMC markers and macrophage markers including CD68 and APOE. This macrophage-like SMC population, representing approximately 15% of all SMCs, was enriched in genes associated with lipid metabolism and inflammatory signaling, suggesting a transdifferentiation process that may contribute to plaque progression. Endothelial cell subclustering identified arterial endothelial cells, venous endothelial cells, and a population of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) cells characterized by co-expression of endothelial markers (PECAM1, VWF) and mesenchymal markers (TAGLN, ACTA2).</p>

<h4>Intercellular Communication</h4>
<p>Intercellular communication analysis using CellChat revealed a complex network of signaling interactions among the identified cell populations. A total of 2,847 significant ligand-receptor interactions were identified, with macrophages and SMCs serving as the dominant signaling hubs. The most active signaling pathways included the CXCL (chemokine), SPP1 (osteopontin), VEGF, TNF, and MIF pathways. Notably, the SPP1 signaling pathway showed the strongest outgoing signals from foam cell macrophages directed toward synthetic SMCs, suggesting a paracrine mechanism by which foam cells may promote SMC phenotypic modulation. The MIF signaling pathway exhibited bidirectional communication between inflammatory macrophages and T cells, consistent with the established role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in sustaining chronic inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques.</p>
<p>Network centrality analysis identified inflammatory macrophages as the primary information source cells, while synthetic SMCs and EndMT cells were the primary receiver cells in the communication network. Analysis of transcription factor regulon activity using SCENIC revealed that the NF-kB family members RELA and NFKB1 were the most active transcription factors in inflammatory macrophages, while KLF4 and TCF21 showed elevated activity in synthetic SMCs, consistent with their known roles in SMC phenotypic switching. These findings highlight the interconnected nature of inflammatory and remodeling processes in carotid atherosclerosis.</p>

<h4>Molecular Docking Results</h4>
<p>Based on the differentially expressed genes and pathway analyses, eight proteins were selected as potential therapeutic targets: SPP1, MIF, TREM2, GPNMB, IL1B, CXCL12, MMP9, and ADAM17. Molecular docking was performed against a library of 1,247 candidate compounds. Cannabidiol exhibited the strongest overall binding affinity profile, with predicted binding energies of -8.9 kcal/mol for SPP1, -8.4 kcal/mol for MIF, and -7.8 kcal/mol for TREM2. Interaction analysis revealed that cannabidiol formed hydrogen bonds with key residues in the active sites of these targets, including Asp142 and Arg168 of SPP1, and the catalytic pocket of MIF involving Pro1 and Lys32. Additional compounds showing strong binding affinities included resveratrol (binding energies ranging from -7.2 to -8.1 kcal/mol) and quercetin (-7.0 to -7.8 kcal/mol). The anti-inflammatory drug colchicine demonstrated moderate binding affinities for MIF (-7.5 kcal/mol) and IL1B (-7.1 kcal/mol).</p>

<h4>Spatial Expression Patterns</h4>
<p>Spatial transcriptomics analysis of carotid atherosclerotic plaque sections revealed distinct region-specific gene expression patterns that corroborated and extended the single-cell findings. Integration of single-cell and spatial data through anchor-based deconvolution enabled mapping of cell type distributions across the plaque architecture. Macrophages and foam cells were predominantly localized to the lipid-rich necrotic core and shoulder regions, while contractile SMCs were concentrated in the fibrous cap and medial layer. The gene ACTC1, encoding cardiac actin alpha 1, showed highly specific expression in the fibrous cap region, co-localizing with contractile SMC markers and suggesting a role in maintaining fibrous cap structural integrity.</p>
<p>AKR1C2, encoding aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C2, exhibited spatial expression confined to the necrotic core region, overlapping with foam cell macrophage signatures. This enzyme, involved in steroid hormone metabolism and prostaglandin regulation, may play a previously unrecognized role in lipid processing within the plaque microenvironment. FABP4, encoding fatty acid binding protein 4, showed a gradient expression pattern extending from the necrotic core to the adventitial layer, consistent with its known role in lipid transport and its expression by both macrophages and adipocyte-like cells in the perivascular tissue. These spatial expression patterns provide a framework for understanding how the identified therapeutic targets are distributed within the plaque architecture, which has implications for targeted drug delivery strategies.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>In this study, we performed an integrated multi-omics analysis combining single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and molecular docking to comprehensively characterize the cellular landscape of carotid atherosclerosis and identify potential therapeutic targets. Our findings reveal a remarkable degree of cellular heterogeneity within carotid atherosclerotic plaques, with multiple previously unrecognized subpopulations and transitional cell states that may play critical roles in plaque progression and instability. The identification of macrophage-like smooth muscle cells and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition cells underscores the phenotypic plasticity that characterizes the atherosclerotic microenvironment.</p>
<p>The intercellular communication analysis provides new insights into the signaling networks that orchestrate the complex interplay between immune and vascular cells in atherosclerosis. The identification of the SPP1 pathway as a dominant axis of communication between foam cell macrophages and synthetic SMCs is particularly noteworthy. SPP1 (osteopontin) has been implicated in atherosclerosis progression through promotion of macrophage recruitment, SMC migration, and calcification. Our findings suggest that targeted disruption of SPP1 signaling may have therapeutic potential by interrupting the paracrine crosstalk that sustains the pro-atherogenic inflammatory milieu.</p>
<p>The molecular docking results identify cannabidiol as a promising candidate compound with strong binding affinities for multiple therapeutic targets in carotid atherosclerosis. Cannabidiol is a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid with established anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory properties. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cannabidiol can attenuate atherosclerosis progression in murine models through reduction of vascular inflammation and oxidative stress. Our computational findings provide a molecular basis for these observations and suggest specific protein targets through which cannabidiol may exert its atheroprotective effects. However, it is important to note that molecular docking predictions require experimental validation through in vitro binding assays and functional studies.</p>
<p>The spatial transcriptomics analysis adds a crucial dimensional layer to our understanding by mapping gene expression to specific plaque regions. The region-specific expression patterns of ACTC1, AKR1C2, and FABP4 suggest that these genes may serve as biomarkers for specific plaque compartments and vulnerability states. The confinement of AKR1C2 expression to the necrotic core is particularly intriguing, as it suggests a potential role in local steroid metabolism that may influence inflammatory processes within the most pathologically active plaque region. These spatial insights have practical implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies and imaging biomarkers for plaque vulnerability assessment.</p>
<p>Several limitations of our study should be acknowledged. First, the single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data were obtained from publicly available datasets, and we were unable to control for potential batch effects or validate clinical information independently. Second, molecular docking provides computational predictions of binding affinity that may not accurately reflect in vivo pharmacological activity, as factors such as bioavailability, metabolism, and off-target effects are not accounted for. Third, the cross-sectional nature of the transcriptomic data precludes inference of temporal dynamics, and the identified cell states and communication networks represent a snapshot of the disease process. Future studies incorporating longitudinal sampling, functional validation of identified targets, and prospective clinical correlations will be essential to translate these findings into therapeutic advances.</p>
