	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: In this study, we evaluated the clinical symptoms and findings, demographic features and prognosis of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertenson (IIH).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Twenty-one patients (18 women, 3 men; mean age 34.9 years; range 16 to 50 years) who fulfilled the modified Dandy&#39;s diagnostic criteria for IIH and were followed in the last 10 years, were included in the study. The presenting complaints, medical history, laboratory data including blood count and routine biochemical assessments, imaging and ophtalmoscopic evaluation data were evaluated.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Headache was the primary symptom (85.7%) on admission. The other presenting symptoms were visual impairment (47.6%), tinnitus (19.0%), nausea-vomiting (38.1%). Papilledema was found in 15 patients (71.4%), nasal and temporal swollen of optic disc in 4 patients (19.0%). Two patients had normal fundus examination. Eight (38.1%) had brain edema. Four out of 16 patients who underwent visual evoked potential, had prolonged P100 latency. Headache and visual symptoms were improved within 8 months follow-up period.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In conclusion, although idiopathic intracranial hypertenson has good prognosis, it may rarely cause permanent visual loss. For this reason, IIH should be considered in young and obese women presenting with headache, visual and auditive symptoms.</p>
