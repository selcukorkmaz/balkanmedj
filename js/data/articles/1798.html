												        						<b>Background: </b>Oxidative stress is implicated as one of the main molecular mechanism underlying silicosis.<br>
<b>Aims:</b> In this study, our aim was to asses the redox status in occupationally silica-exposed workers, by evaluating the dynamic thiol-disulphide homeostasis.<br>
<b>Study Design:</b> Case-control study.<br>
<b>Methods: </b>Thirty-six male workers occupationally exposed to silica particles and 30 healthy volunteers, working as office workers were included to the study. Posteroanterior chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests of both groups were evaluated. Also serum thiol disulphide levels were measured using the spectrophotometric method described by Erel and Neşelioğlu. <br>
<b>Results:</b> Among the 36 workers that underwent pulmonary function tests 6 (17%) had obstructive, 7 (19%) had restrictive, 6 (17%) had obstructive and restrictive signs whereas 17 (47%) had no signs. The mean PFTs results of silica-exposed workers were significantly lower than control subjects. The serum disulphide levels of silica-exposed workers were significantly higher than control subjects (23.84±5.89 μmol/L and 21.18±3.44 μmol/L, respectively p=0.02).<br>
<b>Conclusion: </b>The serum disulphide levels, a biomarker of oxidative stress, are found to be higher in silica-exposed workers.												        					</div>
