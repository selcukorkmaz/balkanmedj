	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The second year students of the Medicine School of Trakya University were asked to evaluate the present theoretical and practical biochemistry education and to give feedback on what they expect from biochemical education.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Data were collected through a questionnaire which did not include identification. The students were asked to rate the following isseus according to a Likert scale from 1 to 5: the clearness and apprehensibility of theoretical lessons; the level of comprehension; communication with lecturers; students&#39; participation in lessons; the present and desired level of directing questions to be answered; the contribution of practical lessons to the understanding of theoretical issues; and the level of dexterity acquired through practical lessons. Also investigated were the teaching materials they preferred in lectures.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Ninety-eight percent (125/128) of the second year students responded the questionnaire. Of these, 35% attended the theoretical lessons on a regular basis, 15% had irregular attendance, and 50% were absentees. The internal reliability of the questionnaire (Cronbach alpha) was 0.68. Ninety-one percent complained of low clearness of theoretical lessons. Although 91.1% were in favor of asking questions, 86.8% refrained themselves from doing so.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although the students did not actually feel themselves being involved in the education, they had considerable desire to increase their participation.</p>
