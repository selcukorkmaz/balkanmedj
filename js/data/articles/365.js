The incidence of bloodstream infections differs among the types of transplantation. The microbiological features and antimicrobial resistance patterns change from centre to centre.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: To evaluate the incidence and spectrum of aetiological agents of bloodstream infections among solid organ transplantation recipients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study</strong> <strong>Design</strong>: Retrospective descriptive study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: Medical records of solid organ transplant recipients in the period between January 1st 2004 and August 15th 2012 were assessed retrospectively. The study population comprised 927 (64 heart, 556 kidney, 307 liver) consecutive recipients. Bloodstream infections were divided into three groups according to the onset time of bloodstream infections after transplantation: early, mid-term and late. The incidence and microbiological features of bloodstream infections were evaluated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The number of bloodstream infection episodes was 317 in 191 recipients which was distributed as 228 (72%) in liver, 70 (22%) in kidney and 19 (6%) in heart transplantation. Ninety-eight 98 (30.9%) of the episodes were diagnosed within the early period, 134 (42.3%) within the mid-term and 85 (26.8%) in the late period. Early and mid-term bloodstream infections were seen statistically more often in liver than in kidney or heart transplantation (p=0.01 and p=0.031, respectively). Late bloodstream infections were also common in liver transplant recipients which was not statistically significant (p=0.229).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Liver transplant recipients are at the highest risk for developing BSI after transplantation in early, mid-term and late periods.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
