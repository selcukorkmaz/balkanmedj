	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Family history of premature atherosclerosis imposes a high risk to people. The relationship between atherosclerosis and gene polymorphisms of various biomarkers such as Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has shown in previous studies.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The major aim of the study was to evaluate the CRP, eNOS, and IL-6 gene polymorphisms in a group of adolescents who have a parental history of early coronary artery disease (CAD).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case-control study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Thirty-six volunteers with a father with obstructive CAD during the first four decades and 46 subjects with a father with normal coronary arteries documented with coronary angiography were included in the study. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques were used to analyze CRP, eNOS, and IL-6 polymorphisms.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: We did not find any differences between the two groups with regard to age, sex, body mass index, renal functions, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, lipid profile, and fasting glucose, hemoglobin, and high sensitivity CRP. A significant difference was only observed in IL-6-572 G/C genotype distribution and allele frequency between two groups (Pc=0.036 OR=3.48 CI (95%) 1.17-10.32).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The present study showed a significant association between the IL-6-572 G/C gene polymorphism (presence of C allele) and adolescents with a parental history of premature CAD.</p>
