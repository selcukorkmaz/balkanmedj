	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: To compare the cephalometric variables of obese (body mass index (BMI) &ge;30) and non-obese (BMI&lt;30) Turkish male patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Materials</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: OSAS diagnosed 85 patients who were obese [n=37; mean age (&plusmn;SE), 49.41&plusmn;1.54 year] and non-obese [n=48; mean age (&plusmn;SE) 46.92&plusmn;1.39 year] were included in the study. The cephalometric measurements and polysomnographic data of the patients were compared and a discriminatory analysis was performed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was significantly higher in obese patients (p&lt;0.01). Bimaxillary protrusion was found in obese patients (p&lt;0.05). The non-obese patients with AHI &ge; 30 had an increased mandibular plane angle In the stepwise discriminant analysis done separately in obese and non-obese patients according to AHI; only the hyoid bone position was included in the model in obese patients and the estimated success of discrimination of AHI&#39;s level (&lt;30 and &ge;30) was 70.3%. Age, anterior face and posterior face height were included to the model in non-obese patients and the estimated success of discrimination was found as 79.2%.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Craniofacial morphology has an effect on the severity of OSAS. If the craniofacial morphology tends toward a worsening of OSAS with obesity, the severity of the OSAS increases.</p>
