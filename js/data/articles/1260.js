Within the recurrent patients, 89.7% had hypertension, 32.3% had atrial fibrillation, 24.4% had diabetes mellitus, 15.6% had transient ischemic attack, and 57.5% had several types of heart diseases. The most frequent recurrence etiology was embolic according to TOAST criteria (35.5%). Transient ischemic attack (OR= 2.98; 95% CI 1.54-5.76), hypertension (OR= 1.96; 95% CI 1.11-2.64) and atrial fibrillation (OR= 1.74; 95% CI 1.44-2.66) were found as the independent risk factors. The mean of the modified Rankin scores of the study group at their last charge were significantly higher than that of the control group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings emphasize the importance of the consistent anticoagulation therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation and close blood pressure control in patients with hypertension.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
