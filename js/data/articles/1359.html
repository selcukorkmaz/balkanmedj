	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: In June 2004, a total of 96 food poisoning cases were determined in university workers and hospitalized patients in the Afyon Kocatepe University. The causes of this food poisoning were investigated in this study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: Patients had symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, weakness, fever, nausea and vomiting. Cultures for bacteria were obtained from the food and patients. Microbiologic and epidemiologic study was performed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Salmonella typhimurium (n=18) and Shigella dysenteria (n=25) were isolated in the samples obtained from the cases, but bacteria weren&#39;t isolated from food samples.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The food poisoning occured most likely as a result of contamination of water containers in which the food was washed. Food products should be washed in fresh and clean water to prevent further poisoning incidents.</p>
