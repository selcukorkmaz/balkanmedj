Recent subanalyses from landmark randomized controlled trials have provided intriguing, albeit preliminary, evidence suggesting that SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce the incidence of new-onset AF and AF-related outcomes in this population.<sup>1,2</sup> Given the high prevalence of AF in HFpEF and its association with worse clinical outcomes, the potential antiarrhythmic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors warrant careful examination.</p>\n<p>The DELIVER trial, which evaluated dapagliflozin in 6,263 patients with HFpEF (ejection fraction &gt;40%), demonstrated a significant reduction in the composite primary endpoint of worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death.<sup>1</sup> A prespecified subanalysis of this trial reported that dapagliflozin reduced the risk of new-onset AF by 19% (hazard ratio 0.81; 95% confidence interval 0.68-0.97) compared with placebo, a finding that was consistent across subgroups defined by age, sex, and baseline ejection fraction.<sup>3</sup> Similarly, the EMPEROR-Preserved trial, which evaluated empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF, showed a numerical reduction in AF events in the empagliflozin group, although this did not reach statistical significance in the prespecified analysis.<sup>2</sup> A pooled analysis of both EMPEROR trials (EMPEROR-Reduced and EMPEROR-Preserved) demonstrated a significant 28% relative risk reduction in new-onset AF with empagliflozin.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the potential antiarrhythmic effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in HFpEF. First, SGLT2 inhibitors exert favorable hemodynamic effects through osmotic diuresis and natriuresis, reducing left atrial pressure and volume, which are key determinants of atrial remodeling and AF substrate formation.<sup>5</sup> Left atrial dilatation, which is particularly prevalent in HFpEF, promotes electrical and structural remodeling that facilitates AF initiation and maintenance. Second, SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to attenuate myocardial fibrosis and inflammation through suppression of the NLRP3 inflammasome, reduction of oxidative stress, and modulation of sodium-hydrogen exchanger activity in cardiomyocytes.<sup>6</sup> These anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects may directly counteract the atrial fibrotic remodeling that underlies AF in HFpEF. Third, improvements in diastolic function and ventricular-arterial coupling with SGLT2 inhibitors may reduce left atrial afterload and wall stress, further mitigating the mechanical stimuli for atrial arrhythmogenesis.<sup>7</sup></p>\n<p>However, several important caveats must be considered. The AF outcomes in the DELIVER and EMPEROR-Preserved trials were secondary or exploratory endpoints, and neither trial was powered to detect differences in AF incidence as a primary outcome. The absence of continuous rhythm monitoring in these trials means that asymptomatic AF episodes may have been missed, potentially underestimating the true AF burden in both treatment groups. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of HFpEF phenotypes complicates the interpretation of aggregate trial results, as the mechanisms linking SGLT2 inhibition to AF prevention may vary across different HFpEF subtypes (obesity-related, aging-related, hypertensive).<sup>8</sup></p>\n<p>Dedicated randomized controlled trials with new-onset AF as the primary endpoint, incorporating continuous rhythm monitoring through implantable loop recorders or wearable devices, are needed to definitively establish the antiarrhythmic efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in HFpEF. Until such evidence is available, the potential reduction in AF risk should be considered an additional benefit of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy in HFpEF rather than a primary indication for their use.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol class=\"references-list\">\n<li>Solomon SD, McMurray JJV, Claggett B, et al.
