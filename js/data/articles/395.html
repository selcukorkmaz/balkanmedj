	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms have recently raised the interest as a possible thrombophilic factors.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: We aimed to assess the frequency of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in idiopathic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in a Romanian population and the associated risk of VTE.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: We performed a case-control transversal study including 90 patients diagnosed with VTE and 75 sex- and age-matched controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms were detected using PCR-RFLP method.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The homozygous MTHFR 677TT genotype, present in 18.8% of patients with VTE versus 6.6% of controls, was significantly associated with VTE (p= 0.021, OR= 3.26, 95%CI (1.141-9.313)). The heterozygous MTHFR A1298C genotype, presenting the highest prevalence in the VTE group (34.4%) as well as in controls (37.3%), was not associated with VTE (p=0.7). No associations were found for heterozygous MTHFR C677T (with a frequency of 32.2% in VTE and 37.3% in controls, p=0.492), respective homozygous MTHFR A1298C genotype (with a frequency of 1.1% in VTE and 2.6% in controls, p=0.456).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Among MTHFR polymorphisms, only homozygosity for MTHFR 677TT may be considered a risk factor for VTE; the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is not significantly associated with an increased risk of VTE.</p>
