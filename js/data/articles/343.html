	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: It is crucial to know anatomic variations and the exact course of an inferior epigastric artery (IEA) to prevent any complications during percutaneous abdominal interventions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of this study was to map the inferior epigastric vessels using reconstructed two-detector computed tomography images and measure the distance from the inferior epigastric artery (IEA) to the midline to determine a safe route for percutaneous abdominal interventions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study</strong> <strong>Design</strong>: Retrospective comparative study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Coronal reconstructed two-detector computed tomography images of 200 patients were evaluated to measure the distances between the IEA and midline at three levels (origin, middle, and distal). Vein and artery arrangements were documented.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The most frequently encountered arrangement (41.5%) was a single vein and artery on both sides. Mean distances on the right and left sides were 4.01 and 4.47 cm at the umbilical level, 3.81 and 4.26 cm at the midlevel, and 5.62 and 5.51 cm at the origin level. On both sides, measurement differences between the three levels were highly significant (p&lt;0.05). In addition, a total of 56 IEA bifurcations were depicted in all 200 patients. Thirteen of the 56 bifurcations occurred only on the right side, 11 only on the left side, and 32 on both sides.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is important to be attentive to the IEA&rsquo;s course, at different midline levels, when attempting percutaneous interventions via an abdominal approach.</p>
