Also, this disease has been an important problem in developed countries due to the increased incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Tuberculosis of the central nervous system is seen in 10% of immunocompetent patients with primary tuberculosis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Case Report</strong>: We report two patients with tuberculoma in the central nervous system. The first case had a lesion located in the medulla oblongata, and the second case had a lesion in the medulla spinalis between the 5th cervical and 1st thoracic vertebral level. Both of these patients underwent surgery.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: CNS tuberculomas may not always show typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs, but when a neurosurgeon encounters a brownyellow rubber-like lesion that is easily extirpated from the glial tissue, tuberculoma should be considered; anti-tuberculous and corticosteroid therapy should be initiated as soon as possible to prevent meningitis and the immune-mediated destructive effects of tuberculosis on the CNS. Whether or not anti-tuberculous therapy is continued can be decided upon by following definitive pathologic diagnosis.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
