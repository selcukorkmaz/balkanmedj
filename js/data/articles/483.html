	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of this study is the histological and immunohistochemical evaluation of ex vivo produced oral mucosal equivalents using keratinocytes cultured by direct explant technique.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Oral mucosa tissue samples were obtained from the keratinized gingival tissues of 14 healthy human subjects. Human oral mucosa keratinocytes from an oral mucosa biopsy specimen were dissociated by the explant technique. Once a sufficient population of keratinocytes was reached, they were seeded onto the type IV collagen coated &ldquo;AlloDerm&rdquo; and taken for histological and immunohistochemical examinations at 11 days postseeding of the keratinocytes on the cadaveric human dermal matrix.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Histopathologically and immunohistochemically, 12 out of 14 successful ex vivo produced oral mucosa equivalents (EVPOME) that consisted of a stratified epidermis on a dermal matrix have been developed with keratinocytes cultured by the explant technique.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The technical handling involved in the direct explant method at the beginning of the process has fewer steps than the enzymatic method and &nbsp;use of the direct explant technique protocol for culturing of human oral mucosa keratinocyte may be more adequate for EVPOME production.</p>
