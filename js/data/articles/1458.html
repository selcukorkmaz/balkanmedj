	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	The prevalence of obesity is increasing. It is one of the commonest pathologies in developed countries. In general, obesity is caused by an imbalance between energy obtained by food and energy expended. A sedentary life-style is also associated with obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases. The result of childhood obesity is adult obesity, so obesity should be treated early. Obesity is a complex problem and effective treatment will probably require incorporation of different approaches. It requires a long-term management similar to that of diabetes or hypertension. A combination of proper diet and regular physical activity is the most effective intervention for weight loss and maintenance of weight management. Other treatment strategies including stress management, radiant heat, sauna, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), laser, acupuncture, and pharmacotherapy seem to be useful methods.</p>
