Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurovascular dysfunction have been proposed as pathways through which depressive states could adversely affect auditory function.<sup>6,7</sup> Elevated cortisol levels, a hallmark of chronic depression, have been shown to impair cochlear blood flow and promote apoptosis of inner ear sensory cells in animal models.<sup>8</sup></p>\n<p>Despite growing interest in this association, the existing literature has several limitations. Most prior studies have relied on cross-sectional designs, precluding assessment of temporal relationships. Furthermore, many investigations have used self-reported hearing difficulty rather than audiometric measurements, and few have examined depressive symptom trajectories over time.<sup>9,10</sup> The dynamic nature of depression, characterized by remission and relapse, suggests that the pattern of depressive symptoms over time may be more informative than single-point assessments in predicting health outcomes.<sup>11</sup></p>\n<p>To address these gaps, we conducted a comprehensive analysis integrating data from three large, population-based cohorts: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). We first performed cross-sectional analyses to establish the association between depressive symptoms and audiometric hearing thresholds. We then leveraged the longitudinal data from HRS and ELSA to identify distinct depressive symptom trajectories and evaluate their predictive value for incident hearing loss over a follow-up period of up to 12 years.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"methods\">\n<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>\n\n<h4>Study Population</h4>\n<p>This study utilized data from three population-based cohorts of adults aged 55 years and older. The NHANES sample comprised participants from the 2011-2012, 2015-2016, and 2017-2020 cycles who completed both audiometric examinations and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). The HRS is a nationally representative longitudinal survey of Americans aged 50 years and older, conducted biennially since 1992; we included participants from the 2006-2018 waves with available audiometric data from the 2016 or 2018 assessments. The ELSA is a longitudinal study of adults aged 50 years and older in England; participants from waves 2 through 9 (2004-2018) with audiometric data from wave 7 (2014-2015) were included.</p>\n<p>Exclusion criteria across all cohorts were: age younger than 55 years, history of congenital hearing loss, prior otologic surgery, diagnosis of Meniere's disease, and incomplete depressive symptom or audiometric data. After applying these criteria, the cross-sectional analyses included 7,843 participants from NHANES, 5,218 from HRS, and 4,692 from ELSA. The longitudinal analyses included 6,956 participants (3,481 from HRS and 3,475 from ELSA) who were free of clinically significant hearing loss at baseline.</p>\n\n<h4>Assessment of Depression</h4>\n<p>Depressive symptoms were assessed using validated screening instruments specific to each cohort. In NHANES, the PHQ-9 was administered during the mobile examination center interview. In HRS and ELSA, the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-8) was used at each wave. To harmonize measures across cohorts, PHQ-9 scores were converted to binary indicators (depressed/not depressed) using the established cutoff of 10 or greater, and CES-D-8 scores used a cutoff of 3 or greater.<sup>12</sup></p>\n<p>For the longitudinal analyses, depressive symptom trajectories were modeled using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) applied to repeated CES-D-8 measurements across four to six waves preceding the audiometric assessment. A censored normal model was fitted, and the optimal number of trajectory groups was determined using Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), average posterior probability of group membership (>0.70), and clinical interpretability. Four trajectory groups were identified: consistently low, increasing, decreasing, and fluctuating depressive symptoms.</p>\n\n<h4>Audiometric Measures</h4>\n<p>Pure-tone audiometry was conducted in sound-treated booths across all three cohorts. Air conduction thresholds were measured at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz in both ears using standardized protocols. The pure-tone average (PTA) was calculated as the mean threshold across these four frequencies in the better-hearing ear. Hearing loss was defined as a PTA greater than 25 dB hearing level (dB HL), consistent with World Health Organization criteria.<sup>13</sup> Severity was further categorized as mild (26-40 dB HL), moderate (41-60 dB HL), and severe (>60 dB HL).</p>\n\n<h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>\n<p>Cross-sectional associations between depressive symptoms and PTA thresholds were examined using multivariable linear regression, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, household income, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, use of ototoxic medications, and noise exposure history. Logistic regression models estimated the odds of hearing loss (PTA >25 dB HL) associated with depression status.</p>\n<p>For the longitudinal analyses, Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between depressive symptom trajectories and incident hearing loss. The proportional hazards assumption was tested using Schoenfeld residuals. Models were progressively adjusted: Model 1 included age and sex; Model 2 additionally included socioeconomic factors; and Model 3 further adjusted for comorbidities and lifestyle factors. Sensitivity analyses included competing risk models (accounting for mortality), stratification by sex, and restriction to participants with complete data across all waves. Restricted cubic spline analysis was performed to explore potential nonlinear associations between baseline CES-D-8 scores and hearing loss risk. All analyses incorporated survey weights where applicable. Statistical significance was set at a two-tailed p-value of less than 0.05. Analyses were performed using R version 4.2.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Stata version 17.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"results\">\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>The overall prevalence of depressive symptoms was 12.4% in the NHANES cohort, 14.1% in HRS, and 11.8% in ELSA. Participants with depressive symptoms were more likely to be female, have lower educational attainment, report lower household income, and have a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease compared to those without depressive symptoms (all p < 0.01). The mean age was 67.2 (SD 8.4) years in the cross-sectional sample and 65.8 (SD 7.6) years in the longitudinal cohort.</p>\n<p>In the cross-sectional analyses, depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher PTA thresholds across all three cohorts after full adjustment. In NHANES, participants with depression had PTA thresholds 2.8 dB HL higher than non-depressed participants (95% CI: 1.6-4.0, p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in HRS (beta = 2.3 dB HL; 95% CI: 1.2-3.4, p < 0.001) and ELSA (beta = 1.9 dB HL; 95% CI: 0.8-3.0, p = 0.001). In logistic regression models, depression was associated with significantly higher odds of hearing loss: NHANES OR = 1.42 (95% CI: 1.18-1.71), HRS OR = 1.35 (95% CI: 1.12-1.63), and ELSA OR = 1.29 (95% CI: 1.06-1.57).</p>\n<p>Among the 6,956 participants in the longitudinal analyses, GBTM identified four depressive symptom trajectories: consistently low (62.3%, n = 4,334), decreasing (14.7%, n = 1,022), increasing (11.8%, n = 821), and fluctuating (11.2%, n = 779). During a median follow-up of 8.4 years (interquartile range: 6.2-10.8), 2,187 participants (31.4%) developed incident hearing loss.</p>\n<p>In the fully adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, relative to the consistently low trajectory group, the increasing depressive symptom trajectory was associated with a significantly elevated risk of incident hearing loss (HR = 1.48; 95% CI: 1.22-1.79; p < 0.001). The fluctuating trajectory also demonstrated a significantly increased hazard (HR = 1.25; 95% CI: 1.03-1.52; p = 0.024). The decreasing trajectory showed a non-significant trend toward increased risk (HR = 1.14; 95% CI: 0.95-1.37; p = 0.16).</p>\n<p>Stratified analyses revealed that the association between the increasing depressive trajectory and hearing loss was stronger among women (HR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.24-2.12) than among men (HR = 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02-1.76; p for interaction = 0.048). The restricted cubic spline analysis indicated a positive, approximately linear relationship between baseline CES-D-8 scores and hearing loss risk (p for nonlinearity = 0.31). Sensitivity analyses using competing risk models yielded results consistent with the primary findings. The cumulative incidence of hearing loss at 10 years was 28.1% in the consistently low group, 31.9% in the decreasing group, 39.6% in the increasing group, and 34.2% in the fluctuating group.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"discussion\">\n<h3>Discussion</h3>\n<p>In this multi-cohort study of adults aged 55 years and older, we found consistent cross-sectional associations between depressive symptoms and poorer audiometric hearing thresholds across three large, population-based samples. More importantly, our longitudinal analyses revealed that trajectories of increasing and fluctuating depressive symptoms over time were independent predictors of incident hearing loss, even after adjustment for a comprehensive set of confounders.</p>\n<p>The magnitude of the cross-sectional associations observed in our study aligns with previous reports. A meta-analysis by Lawrence et al. found a pooled odds ratio of 1.47 for hearing loss among individuals with depression, which is comparable to our NHANES estimate of 1.42.<sup>14</sup> However, our study extends this evidence by demonstrating that the temporal pattern of depressive symptoms is particularly informative. The increasing trajectory, characterized by worsening depressive symptoms over time, conferred a 48% higher risk of hearing loss, suggesting that chronic or escalating psychological distress may have cumulative effects on the auditory system.</p>\n<p>Several biological mechanisms may underlie these findings. Chronic depression is associated with sustained activation of the HPA axis, resulting in elevated circulating cortisol levels.<sup>15</sup> The cochlea is highly sensitive to glucocorticoid signaling, and prolonged cortisol exposure has been shown to reduce cochlear blood flow, promote hair cell apoptosis, and impair synaptic transmission between inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in preclinical models.<sup>16,17</sup> Additionally, depression is characterized by a state of chronic low-grade inflammation, with elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein.<sup>18</sup> These inflammatory mediators have been implicated in strial dysfunction and endolymphatic ion homeostasis disruption within the cochlea.<sup>19</sup></p>\n<p>Oxidative stress represents another plausible pathway. Depression has been associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and decreased antioxidant capacity.<sup>20</sup> The cochlea, particularly the stria vascularis and outer hair cells, is highly vulnerable to oxidative damage due to its high metabolic rate and limited antioxidant defense mechanisms.<sup>21</sup> Furthermore, depression-related neurovascular dysfunction, including endothelial impairment and reduced microvascular perfusion, could compromise the delicate blood supply to the inner ear.<sup>22</sup></p>\n<p>The observation that the decreasing depressive trajectory was not significantly associated with hearing loss risk is noteworthy. This may suggest that resolution of depressive symptoms, whether through treatment or natural remission, attenuates the adverse effects on the auditory system. This finding has potential clinical implications, as it supports the hypothesis that effective management of depression could mitigate hearing loss risk, although this requires confirmation in interventional studies.</p>\n<p>Our finding of a stronger association among women is consistent with sex-specific differences in both depression neurobiology and susceptibility to hearing loss.<sup>23</sup> Hormonal factors, particularly the decline in estrogen during menopause, may modulate both depressive vulnerability and cochlear susceptibility, as estrogen receptors are expressed in the cochlea and have been shown to exert protective effects.<sup>24</sup></p>\n<p>This study has several strengths, including the use of three large, well-characterized cohorts with audiometric measurements, validated depression instruments, trajectory modeling to capture the dynamic nature of depressive symptoms, and comprehensive adjustment for confounders. However, several limitations should be noted. First, despite the longitudinal design, residual confounding cannot be excluded, particularly from unmeasured factors such as genetic susceptibility, subclinical cochlear pathology, and detailed noise exposure data. Second, harmonization of depressive measures across cohorts required dichotomization, which may have reduced measurement precision. Third, the GBTM approach assigns individuals to trajectory groups based on posterior probability, which introduces some classification uncertainty. Fourth, audiometric data were available at a single time point in HRS and ELSA, precluding assessment of hearing loss progression. Fifth, our findings may not be generalizable to populations younger than 55 years or to non-Western cohorts.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this multi-cohort study provides robust evidence that depressive symptoms are associated with hearing loss in older adults, and that increasing and fluctuating depressive trajectories are independent predictors of incident hearing loss. These findings underscore the importance of integrated approaches to mental health and sensory function in aging populations and suggest that addressing depression may have benefits extending beyond mood regulation to include preservation of auditory function. Future research should investigate the mechanistic pathways linking depression to cochlear pathology and evaluate whether depression treatment can reduce hearing loss incidence.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol class=\"references-list\">\n<li>GBD 2019 Hearing Loss Collaborators.
