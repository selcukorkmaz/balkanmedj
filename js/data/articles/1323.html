	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Objectives: We evaluated the effects of alpha-tocopherol on serum cytokine levels and gastric intramucosal pH in patients with severe sepsis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients ve Methods: </strong>Forty patients with severe sepsis were randomized to two groups. Group I (n=20) received 600 mg alpha-tocopherol intramuscularly, and group II (control group, n=20) received the same dose physiological saline solution for three days. The following data were recorded for both groups: hemodynamic parameters, glutathione, catalase levels, nasopharyngeal body temperature, arterial blood gas changes, plasma cytokine levels (interleukin 1&le; and 6), biochemical parameters and intramucosal pH, length of stay in the intensive care unit, duration of mechanical ventilation support, and mortality. All measurements were made at baseline (15 min before alpha-tocopherol administration) and 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours after alpha-tocopherol administration.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results:</strong> None of the parameters evaluated differed significantly between the two groups (p&gt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion:</strong> We found that intramuscular alpha-tocopherol 600 mg did not affect hemodynamic and biochemical parameters, gastric intramucosal pH, cytokine levels, or prognosis in patients with severe sepsis.</p>
