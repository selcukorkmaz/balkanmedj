	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: To determine the value of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-enhanced MR imaging in malignant liver lesions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Materials</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: Twenty patients with various hepatic masses or metastases were investigated with 1 tesla MR. T1-weighted FLASH and double- echo TSE T2-weighted sequences were applied before and after contrast injection. &ldquo;Defining statistics&rdquo; were prepared according to pre and postcontrast signal intensity measurements.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: In this study there were 11 patients with metastases, 4 patients with hemangioma, 4 patients with HCC and one patient with a hemangioma and a metastasis at the same time. In cases wheret we found only hemangiomas, in all sequences, S/N ratios (p=0.043) and T2-weighted double-echo TSE with long TE SI change (p=0.043) were significant. While in the hemangiomas in T2-weighted double-echo TSE with long TE there is an decrease in the C/N ratios; in cases with metastasis and HCC, compared to other sequences significant increase in C/N ratio in T2-weighted double-echo TSE with short TE sequences was detected.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: SPIO-enhanced MR imaging can be used as a non-invasive radiologic technique for the detection focal liver lesions, to determine the number of lesions and also has a value in differentiating the benign lesions (especially hemangiomas) from primary tumors or metastatic malignant lesions.</p>
