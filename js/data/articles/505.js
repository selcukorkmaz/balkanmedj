Major families of the strains were LAM (38%), T (35%), Haarlem (7%), Beijing (2%), S (2%) and U (1%) families. The clustering rate by spoligotyping was calculated as 75%. The most predominant SIT cluster was SIT41 (29%). According to the results of IS6110 RFLP, 71 different patterns of IS6110 were observed. Low copy number was found in 26% of the strains. When the results of two methods were combined, the final clustering rate was calculated as 26%.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusions</strong>: The genotypical distribution of drug resistant tuberculosis isolates in our region indicates genetic diversity and the clustering rate was found low in our region. However, more comprehensive and long-term molecular epidemiological studies are needed to control the drug resistant strains.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
