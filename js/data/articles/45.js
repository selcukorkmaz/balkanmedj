It showed isoattenuation, similar to the adjacent muscle on pre-contrast computed tomography (CT) images, and strong, heterogeneous enhancement following contrast material administration, which may reflect hypervascularity. On pathological examination, it consisted of spindle cells, squeezed between abundant collagen, and focally prominent vascularity in a staghorn feature. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for CD34, BCL2 and CD99. Based on the combination of architectural and immunohistochemical criteria, we ultimately diagnosed this case as an SFT.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion:</strong>&nbsp;Until now, only 14 cases of laryngeal SFT have been described in the literature: 13 located in the supraglottic areas and only one located in the subglottic/tracheal area. Therefore the present case is the second case of a subglottic SFT reported. Although rare, SFT should be included in the differential diagnosis of a well-marginated laryngeal mass with highly intense contrast enhancement, which suggests rich tumor vascularity.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
