	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: In spite of the wide prevalence and growing incidence of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection (HSV-1), relatively few data have been published regarding the seroepidemiology of the infection in the Turkish population. The study was designed to determine the age and sex-specific seroepidemiology of HSV-1 infection in the Black Sea region of Turkey.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Between March 1 and April 30, 2007, 1072 blood samples were randomly collected and examined by virus neutralization test (VNT) from patients aged 5-84 years who were referred to the University hospital outpatient clinics for various reasons in Black Sea Region of Turkey.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Overall HSV-1 seroprevalence was 59.7% (640/1072), and 58% of males (283/490) and 62% of females (357/582) were HSV-1 positive (p&gt;0.05). In the group aged 15-19, seropositivity was significantly higher than in the group aged 19-24 (p=0.0333).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Subgroup analysis indicates a higher HSV-1 infection seropositivity than had been estimated in children and adolescents in the Black Sea region of Turkey. The high prevalence of HSV-1 infection in children underlines the need for education among potential risk groups.</p>
