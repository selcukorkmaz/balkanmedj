	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Background</strong>: The oral ingestion of elemental mercury is unlikely to cause systemic toxicity, as it is poorly absorbed through the gastrointestinal system. However, abnormal gastrointestinal function or anatomy may allow elemental mercury into the bloodstream and the peritoneal space. Systemic effects of massive oral intake of mercury have rarely been reported.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: In this paper, we are presenting the highest ingle oral intake of elemental mercury by a child aged 3 years. A Libyan boy aged 3 years ingested approximately 750 grams of elemental mercury and was still asymptomatic.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The patient had no existing disease or abnormal gastrointestinal function or anatomy. The physical examination was normal. His serum mercury level was 91 &mu;g/L (normal: &lt;5 &mu;g/L), and he showed no clinical manifestations. Exposure to mercury in children through different circumstances remains a likely occurrence.</p>
