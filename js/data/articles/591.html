	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The role of oxidant damage on the development of end-organ injuries caused by diabetic rat is well known. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of quercetin, which is a strong antioxidant bioflavonoid, on oxidant damage and antioxidant capacity in various organs in the case of medium-term or long-term diabetic rat.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Forty-eight male Wistar rats were divided into five groups, namely, control group, diabetic group of 8-weeks, diabetic group of 16-weeks, quercetin treated diabetic group of 8-weeks, and quercetin treated diabetic group of 16-weeks. At the end of the experiment, malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured in the lung, aorta, heart, spleen, liver, and kidney tissues.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: MDA levels were elevated in all tissues except in the lung in non-treated diabetic groups. Quercetin treatment increased the antioxidant enzyme capacities and considerably reduced oxidant damage.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We suggest that quercetin has a protective effect on the aorta, heart, brain, liver, and kidneys from oxidant damage in the case of mediumterm or long-term diabetic rat. It can be argued that quercetin is effective by increasing the antioxidant defence capacity in this process.</p>
