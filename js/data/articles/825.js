The population of the study included the attending emergency physicians and residents at university hospitals in Turkey. The surveys were returned by mail after having been filled out by twenty-four departments participating in the study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Two hundred sixty three of 322 emergency physicians completed the survey (coverage rate: 81.6%). Twenty five percent (n=66) of 263 physicians were emergency medicine specialists. Fifty four percent (n=143) of the participants stated that the use of analgesics &ldquo;repressed the physical examination findings&rdquo;. Rates in analgesic use also increased in parallel with increases in physicians&#39; ages and were found statistically significant. Moreover, a regional difference among rates of analgesic use was observed (p&lt;0.05).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Rates of administering analgesics for patients with acute abdominal pain by university emergency physicians in Turkey are quite low. Physicians&#39; ages, regional location of the hospitals, physical examination findings, radiological examination results, quality and level of pain and received diagnosis are the factors affecting the decision-making process in administering analgesics.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
