Possible risk factors were evaluated by a questionnaire. Sera obtained from volunteers were preserved in &ndash;70˚C deep freezer until the study is done. Antibodies against Anaplasma phagocytophilum were investigated by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test in the sera.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: Antibodies against A. phagocytophilum were positive for 29 individuals (25%).
