												        						<p><strong>Background:</strong> Approximately half of the children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder continue to meet diagnostic criteria in adulthood. The prevalence of adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is reported between 2.5% and 4.4% and is associated with significant impairment in quality of life and increased psychiatric comorbidity. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults remains mostly undiagnosed and/or untreated despite the availability of effective treatments. The majority of people who do not receive necessary treatment are in the nonclinical or nonpsychiatric clinical population. Screening is an important step for diagnosing adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Yet, there are no valid and reliable screening questionnaires calibrated for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-5 in Turkish.<br /><strong>Aims:</strong> We aimed to test the reliability and the validity of the Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5 screening questionnaire designed according to DSM-5 in the Turkish population.<br /><strong>Study Design:</strong> Methodological and cross-sectional study.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> The translation was carried out according to the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview translation guide using a linguistic adaptation approach. We used a convenience sampling method to recruit an individual with adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 68) and a control group (n = 68). The participants completed a sociodemographic form, 6-items Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5, and the previous version 18-items Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-v1.1 for the concurrent validity analysis. For the diagnostic validity, clinical diagnosis made by psychiatrists according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-5 criteria was used. Internal consistency and item-total correlation coefficients, exploratory factor analyses, correlation with Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-v1.1, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were conducted.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The internal consistency measured by Cronbach alpha was 0.869. Item-total correlation coefficients were calculated to be between 0.602 and 0.717, and the correlations were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.0001). The Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5 showed to have a unidimensional factor structure explaining 60.54% of the variance. The correlation between Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5 and Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-v1.1 total score was calculated as 0.992 (P &lt; 0.0001), and that between Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5 and Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-v1.1 attention-deficit subdimension was 0.868 (P &lt; 0.0001). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis of Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5, the area under the curve was found to be 0.916. The cut-off score was calculated as 9 of 10 with a sensitivity of 85.2% and specificity of 89.7%.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Adult Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Self-Report Scale-5 is a valid and reliable self-report measure to assess and screen attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in the Turkish population. It may be useful for both clinical and population studies.</p>												        					</div>
