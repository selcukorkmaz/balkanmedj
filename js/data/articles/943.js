Local recurrences, regional lymph node and distant metastases of MCC are frequent but to date metastasis to upper gastrointestinal tract was reported only a few. We present a 75-yearold man who had primary MCC at his left thigh. The tumor was excised and the patient was directed to local radiotherapy. He had developed abdominal and thoracal subcutaneous metastatic nodules within 5 and 8 months after surgical excision, respectively. In the tenth month, a second operation had to be performed because of a perforated duodenal ulcer and incidentally a submucosal yellow-white nodule measuring 2 cm in diameter was found in the wall of gastric cardia and excised. This lesion was histologically identical to the primary tumor, hence, gastric metastasis of MCC. The patient rejected further therapy and died 17 months after the initial diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of MCC and distinction of gastrointestinal MCC metastasis from primary neuroendocrine tumors may be difficult. Clinical information and histopathological features along with the results of immunohistochemical stainings are very important in this distinction.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
