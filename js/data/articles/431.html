	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Methotrexate (MTX) is known to have deleterious side effects on lung tissue. We aimed to investigate the effects of erythropoietin (EPO) and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) on MTX-induced lung injury in rats.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Animal experiment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Twenty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups. Sham group, 0.3 mL saline; MTX group, 5 mg/kg MTX; EPO group, 5mg/kg MTX and 2000 IU/kg EPO; NAC group, 5 mg/kg MTX and 200 mg/kg NAC were administered once daily for 4 consecutive days. Malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and inflammation and congestion scores in lung tissues were evaluated.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: In MTX group MDA were significantly higher, CAT and SOD were significantly lower than in sham, EPO and NAC groups (p&lt;0.005). In EPO group MDA, CAT, and SOD were higher, but not significant than those in group NAC (p&gt;0.005). In group MTX both scores were significantly higher than in sham (p&lt;0.005). The congestion score of group MTX was significantly higher than those of group EPO and NAC (p&lt;0.005).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: EPO and NAC have significant preventive effects on MTX-induced lung injury in rats. Decreased antioxidant capacity and increased MDA level may cause the oxidative damage in MTX group. Also, higher antioxidant capacity and lower MDA level may be a response to oxidative stress in EPO and NAC groups.</p>
