In this study, we evaluated the results of FISH analyses in patients with hematologic malignancies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: FISH analyses were performed in bone marrow samples of 36 patients with an initial or confirmed diagnosis of hematologic malignancy. The cells were cultured for 4, 24, 48, or 72 hours depending on the type of disease. The images obtained from each case were processed on a computer with the SPOT RT program.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Using locus specific FISH probes, chromosomal translocation at t(9;22) was studied in 24 patients, t(15;17) was studied in 12 patients, t(8;21) and inv 16 t(16;16) were studied in six patients. In patients with an initial diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia, t(9;22) was positive in 60% to 90%. The detection of chromosomal aberrations associated with other hematologic malignancies ranged between 3% to 74%. The FISH analysis was also successful in showing decreases in chromosomal aberrations in patients under follow-up.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: FISH analysis is of particular help in both the initial diagnosis of, and monitoring chromosomal aberrations in the follow-up of hematologic malignancies.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
