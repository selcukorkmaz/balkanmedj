By the proceeding technology and sedative lifetyle and obesity becoming widespread, diabetes is becoming more and more frequent throughout the world. 90% of individuals with diabetes mellitus have type 2 diabetes. Obesity, particularly central obesity is a common risk factor. The effect of diabetes on the morbidity and mortality of subjects affected by it necessitates a comprehensive approach of primary and secondary prevention. Screening for diabetes is recommended every three years in people at or above age 40. Earlier and more frequent screening is recommended for high-risk patients. The recommended screening test is fasting plasma glucose. Given the high prevalence of macro and microvascular complications, even at the time of diagnosis (almost 50%), diabetes complications must be thoroughly screened for and additional risk factors (e.g. dyslipidemia, hypertension, microalbuminuria/ proteinuria) aggressively treated. Therapy often begins with modification of lifestyle and diet and frequently requires treatment with antihyperglycemic agents.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
