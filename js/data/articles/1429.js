All wound surfaces were cleaned using physiologic serum and dressed with antibacterial pomade. Linear polarized polychromatic light was applied directly through the skin with the Biolamp device, at a dose of 1.3 J/cm2 for 6 minutes daily from a distance of 10 cm. Ulcer area measurements were calculated as square centimeters on a graph paper at baseline and on the seventh and 15th days of treatment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Comparisons of mean wound areas within each group showed significant improvements on the seventh and 15th days of treatment (p&lt;0.05). However, it was noted that healing of larger wound areas was faster and more effective in patients treated with LPPL.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results suggest that LPPL is more effective in treating grade II and grade III pressure wounds.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
