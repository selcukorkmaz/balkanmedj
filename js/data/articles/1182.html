	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	During abdominal dissection of a 32-year-old Caucasian female cadaver, an anomalous artery originating from the anterior aspect of the abdominal aorta was found. This artery had its origin between the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries. It was 2.2 mm in diameter and formed an arch ascending to the left of the midline supplying the transverse colon. It was divided into right and left branches; the former anastomosing with the right colic artery, the latter with the left. During the diagnostic imaging of the abdominal vasculature and the practice of colonic surgery, the possibility of the existence of an anomalous artery must be kept in mind.</p>
