The term cannabinoids encompasses a diverse group of compounds including phytocannabinoids derived from Cannabis sativa, endocannabinoids produced endogenously, and an ever-expanding array of synthetic cannabinoids manufactured in clandestine laboratories. While the therapeutic potential of certain cannabinoids has gained increasing recognition, the proliferation of synthetic variants has created a parallel public health crisis that demands urgent attention from the medical community.</p>\n<p>The medicinal use of cannabinoids has a history spanning millennia, but it is only in recent decades that rigorous scientific investigation has begun to elucidate their pharmacological mechanisms. The discovery of the endocannabinoid system, comprising CB1 and CB2 receptors along with endogenous ligands such as anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, has provided a neurobiological framework for understanding both the therapeutic and adverse effects of cannabinoids. Cannabidiol (CBD) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of refractory epilepsy syndromes, particularly Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, leading to regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its synthetic analogs have established roles in chemotherapy-induced nausea, AIDS-associated wasting, and chronic pain management, though the evidence base for some indications remains limited.</p>\n<p>However, the therapeutic narrative must be balanced against growing concerns regarding cannabinoid toxicity, particularly in vulnerable populations. Pediatric exposures to cannabinoid-containing products have increased dramatically in regions where cannabis has been legalized or decriminalized. Emergency department visits for unintentional pediatric ingestion of cannabis edibles have risen by over 300% in some jurisdictions over the past five years. The clinical presentation in children can be severe, including profound central nervous system depression, respiratory compromise, and seizures, with some cases requiring intensive care admission. These incidents highlight the critical importance of child-resistant packaging, public education, and stringent regulatory oversight of cannabinoid products.</p>\n<p>The synthetic cannabinoid crisis presents an even more alarming picture. These compounds, often marketed as \"legal highs\" or \"herbal incense,\" are designed to mimic the effects of THC but frequently possess dramatically higher potency and unpredictable pharmacological profiles. Unlike plant-derived cannabinoids, which are partial agonists at CB1 receptors, many synthetic cannabinoids are full agonists with binding affinities orders of magnitude greater than THC. This pharmacological distinction translates into a markedly different clinical toxicity profile, characterized by severe agitation, psychosis, seizures, rhabdomyolysis, acute kidney injury, and cardiovascular collapse. Mass casualty events involving synthetic cannabinoids have been reported with increasing frequency across the Balkans and globally, overwhelming emergency medical services and highlighting the limitations of current analytical detection methods.</p>\n<p>The regulatory landscape surrounding cannabinoids remains fragmented and inconsistent. While some countries have implemented comprehensive medical cannabis programs with quality control standards and physician oversight, others maintain prohibitionist policies that may inadvertently drive consumers toward unregulated and potentially dangerous products. A rational approach to cannabinoid policy should be grounded in scientific evidence, balancing patient access to therapeutically validated compounds with robust safeguards against misuse and diversion. Healthcare professionals must be equipped with current knowledge regarding both the benefits and risks of cannabinoids to provide evidence-based guidance to patients and policymakers alike.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, cannabinoids represent both medicine and poison, and the distinction between these roles depends on the specific compound, dose, route of administration, patient population, and regulatory context. As the scientific understanding of the endocannabinoid system continues to evolve, so too must our approach to harnessing therapeutic potential while mitigating toxicological risks. The medical community has a responsibility to lead this conversation with objectivity, scientific rigor, and a commitment to patient safety.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol class=\"references-list\">\n<li>Pertwee RG.
