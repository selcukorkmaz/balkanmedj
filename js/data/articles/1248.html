	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The C825T polymorphism of the gene encoding the G-protein beta-3 subunit (GNB3) is associated with enhanced signal transduction via G proteins which in turn results in an increased Na+/H+ exchanger activity. This ion transport system mediates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Increased activity of Na+/H+ exchanger was found in the cells of patients with arterial hypertension in different populations. We investigated this polymorphism in a Turkish group of patients with hypertension and compared them with normotensive subjects.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: 99 hypertensive patients (57 males, 42 females) and 45 normotensive controls (33 males, 12 females) were genotyped for the GNB3 C825T polymorphism.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Allele distribution of patient and control groups were CC: 35, CT: 51, TT: 13 and CC: 26, CT: 15, TT: 4, respectively. T-allele carriers (CT and TT) were significantly higher in hypertensive group. There was also a statistically significant (Chi-square test, p=0.041) relationship between 825T allele and hypertension.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results suggest that hypertension is related with GNB3 polymorphism in Turkish patients and increased G protein activity may be the pathophysiologic link between C825T and hypertension.</p>
