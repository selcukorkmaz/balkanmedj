In heart failure, XO activity is upregulated due to tissue hypoxia, neurohormonal activation, and increased purine turnover from myocardial energy depletion.<sup>5</sup> Elevated XO activity and consequent hyperuricemia contribute to a cascade of pathological processes including oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and myocardial fibrosis, all of which exacerbate ventricular remodeling and hemodynamic deterioration.<sup>6,7</sup> Furthermore, uric acid has direct pro-inflammatory effects through activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and stimulation of pro-fibrotic pathways in cardiac fibroblasts.<sup>8</sup></p>\n<p>Febuxostat is a selective, non-purine XO inhibitor that has demonstrated superior uric acid-lowering efficacy compared to allopurinol.<sup>9</sup> Beyond its urate-lowering properties, febuxostat has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, improve endothelial function, and attenuate myocardial fibrosis in experimental models of heart failure.<sup>10,11</sup> These pleiotropic effects suggest that febuxostat may offer therapeutic benefits in heart failure beyond uric acid reduction alone. However, clinical evidence regarding the cardiovascular effects of febuxostat in heart failure patients has been limited and inconsistent, with particular uncertainty regarding differential effects across heart failure phenotypes.</p>\n<p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF), and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) represent distinct clinical entities with different pathophysiological underpinnings.<sup>12</sup> HFpEF is increasingly recognized as a systemic syndrome driven by comorbidity-associated inflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and cardiometabolic dysregulation, whereas HFrEF is primarily characterized by cardiomyocyte loss and neurohormonal overactivation.<sup>13</sup> Given that hyperuricemia and XO overactivity are particularly linked to the inflammatory and metabolic pathways central to HFpEF pathophysiology, it is biologically plausible that uric acid-lowering therapy with febuxostat may be more beneficial in this phenotype.</p>\n<p>To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a prospective observational cohort study to evaluate the effects of febuxostat-based uric acid-lowering therapy on clinical outcomes in heart failure patients with hyperuricemia, with a particular focus on differential effects across HFpEF, HFmrEF, and HFrEF phenotypes.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"methods\">\n<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>\n<p>This prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study enrolled consecutive patients with chronic heart failure and concomitant hyperuricemia from five tertiary care hospitals between January 2017 and December 2019. Patients were followed for a minimum of five years through December 2024. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the coordinating center and all participating sites. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>\n<p>Inclusion criteria were: (1) age 18 years or older; (2) diagnosis of chronic heart failure according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines, with symptoms present for at least 3 months;<sup>12</sup> (3) documented hyperuricemia (SUA > 7.0 mg/dL in men or > 6.0 mg/dL in women) on at least two measurements within the preceding 6 months; and (4) stable heart failure therapy for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Exclusion criteria were: severe chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), active gout flare at enrollment, prior use of febuxostat, known hypersensitivity to xanthine oxidase inhibitors, active malignancy, severe hepatic impairment, pregnancy or lactation, and life expectancy less than 12 months from non-cardiac causes.</p>\n<p>Patients were classified into heart failure phenotypes based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at enrollment: HFpEF (LVEF &ge; 50%), HFmrEF (LVEF 41-49%), and HFrEF (LVEF &le; 40%). LVEF was measured by transthoracic echocardiography using the biplane Simpson's method by experienced echocardiographers blinded to treatment allocation.</p>\n<p>Treatment assignment was non-randomized and based on clinical decision. Patients who initiated febuxostat therapy (starting dose 40 mg daily, titrated to 80 mg daily if SUA remained above target at 4 weeks) constituted the treatment group. Patients who did not receive febuxostat (either receiving no uric acid-lowering therapy or continuing prior allopurinol) constituted the control group. To mitigate selection bias inherent to the observational design, propensity score matching was performed within each heart failure phenotype using a 1:1 nearest-neighbor algorithm with a caliper width of 0.2 standard deviations of the logit of the propensity score. The propensity score model included age, sex, body mass index, LVEF, NYHA functional class, SUA level, eGFR, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, diuretics, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.</p>\n<p>The primary composite endpoint was cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization. Secondary endpoints included the individual components of the primary endpoint, all-cause mortality, change in NYHA functional class, change in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), change in BNP/NT-proBNP levels, and change in echocardiographic parameters (LVEF, left atrial volume index, E/e' ratio) at 12 months and at the end of follow-up. Safety endpoints included gout flares, hepatic transaminase elevation (> 3x upper limit of normal), cardiovascular events potentially attributable to febuxostat (myocardial infarction, stroke), and treatment discontinuation.</p>\n<p>Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and annually thereafter. Each visit included clinical evaluation, NYHA class assessment, blood sampling (including SUA, renal function, hepatic function, BNP/NT-proBNP), and echocardiography (at baseline, 12 months, and end of follow-up). 6MWD was assessed at baseline and 12 months.</p>\n<p>Continuous variables were presented as means (SD) or medians (IQR) as appropriate, and compared using t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, or paired tests for within-group changes. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. The primary endpoint was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models, with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals reported. The proportional hazards assumption was verified using Schoenfeld residuals and log-log survival plots. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for the primary endpoint, and differences were assessed using the log-rank test. Subgroup analyses were prespecified for BNP tertiles, SUA tertiles, eGFR categories, diabetes status, and SGLT2 inhibitor use. Sensitivity analyses included inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and analysis of the unmatched cohort with multivariable adjustment. All analyses were performed using R version 4.3.0 with the survival, MatchIt, and survey packages. A two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. No adjustment for multiple comparisons was made for exploratory subgroup analyses.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"results\">\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>A total of 2,005 patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled (859 HFpEF, 412 HFmrEF, 734 HFrEF). Among these, 1,038 (51.8%) received febuxostat and 967 (48.2%) served as controls. After propensity score matching, 1,542 patients were retained (771 matched pairs). The matched cohorts were well balanced for all measured covariates, with standardized mean differences less than 0.10 for all variables across all three phenotype strata.</p>\n<p>Baseline characteristics of the matched cohort were as follows: mean age 68.4 (SD 11.7) years, 58.1% male, mean LVEF 46.2% (SD 14.8%), median BNP 287 pg/mL (IQR 148-562), mean SUA 8.6 (SD 1.8) mg/dL, and mean eGFR 56.3 (SD 21.4) mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. NYHA class distribution was: class II 52.3%, class III 38.9%, and class IV 8.8%. The prevalence of key comorbidities was: diabetes mellitus 42.7%, hypertension 78.4%, atrial fibrillation 35.6%, and coronary artery disease 61.2%.</p>\n<p>During a median follow-up of 5.2 years (IQR 4.1-5.8), the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization occurred in 524 patients (34.0%) in the overall matched cohort. In the febuxostat group, the event rate was 31.4% compared with 36.6% in the control group (HR = 0.837; 95% CI: 0.706-0.993; p = 0.041).</p>\n<p>Critically, the treatment effect differed substantially across heart failure phenotypes (p for interaction = 0.008). In the HFpEF cohort (n = 642 matched), febuxostat was associated with a significant 25.6% reduction in the primary endpoint (HR = 0.744; 95% CI: 0.589-0.939; p = 0.013). The event rate was 27.8% in the febuxostat group versus 36.1% in the control group. In the HFmrEF cohort (n = 318 matched), there was a numerically lower but statistically non-significant reduction (HR = 0.862; 95% CI: 0.614-1.211; p = 0.39). In the HFrEF cohort (n = 582 matched), no benefit was observed (HR = 0.978; 95% CI: 0.786-1.217; p = 0.84).</p>\n<p>Analysis of secondary endpoints in the HFpEF cohort revealed that febuxostat significantly reduced heart failure hospitalizations (HR = 0.702; 95% CI: 0.531-0.928; p = 0.013) and showed a trend toward reduced cardiovascular mortality (HR = 0.812; 95% CI: 0.581-1.135; p = 0.22). All-cause mortality was not significantly different (HR = 0.864; 95% CI: 0.657-1.137; p = 0.30). At 12 months, HFpEF patients receiving febuxostat demonstrated significant improvements compared to controls in 6MWD (mean change +28.4 m vs +8.7 m, p = 0.003), NYHA class (improvement by &ge; 1 class: 38.2% vs 24.1%, p = 0.001), and BNP levels (median change -62 pg/mL vs -18 pg/mL, p = 0.008). Echocardiographic parameters showed modest improvements in E/e' ratio (mean change -1.4 vs -0.3, p = 0.02) and left atrial volume index (mean change -2.8 vs -0.6 mL/m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.04), with no significant change in LVEF in either group.</p>\n<p>In contrast, among HFrEF patients, there were no significant differences between febuxostat and control groups in any secondary endpoint, including 6MWD, NYHA class improvement, BNP changes, or echocardiographic parameters, despite comparable reductions in SUA levels (febuxostat: -4.2 mg/dL vs controls: -0.3 mg/dL in both HFpEF and HFrEF cohorts).</p>\n<p>Prespecified subgroup analyses within the HFpEF cohort revealed that the benefit of febuxostat was most pronounced in patients with elevated baseline BNP (highest tertile, >450 pg/mL: HR = 0.612; 95% CI: 0.432-0.868; p = 0.006) and elevated SUA (highest tertile, >9.5 mg/dL: HR = 0.648; 95% CI: 0.458-0.917; p = 0.014). Patients with coexisting diabetes derived significant benefit (HR = 0.681; 95% CI: 0.498-0.931; p = 0.016), as did those not receiving SGLT2 inhibitors (HR = 0.698; 95% CI: 0.534-0.912; p = 0.008). Interestingly, among HFpEF patients receiving concomitant SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, the benefit of febuxostat was attenuated and non-significant (HR = 0.894; 95% CI: 0.598-1.336; p = 0.58), suggesting potential mechanistic overlap between the two drug classes.</p>\n<p>SUA levels decreased significantly in the febuxostat group across all phenotypes, reaching a mean of 4.8 (SD 1.2) mg/dL at 12 months compared with 8.2 (SD 1.9) mg/dL in controls (p < 0.001). The target SUA level of less than 6.0 mg/dL was achieved in 82.4% of febuxostat-treated patients at 12 months.</p>\n<p>Regarding safety, gout flares occurred more frequently in the febuxostat group during the first 3 months (8.2% vs 3.1%, p < 0.001) but equalized thereafter. Hepatic transaminase elevations occurred in 2.8% of febuxostat-treated patients, necessitating dose reduction in 1.4% and discontinuation in 0.5%. Rates of myocardial infarction (2.1% vs 2.4%, p = 0.72) and stroke (1.8% vs 1.6%, p = 0.78) were similar between groups. Overall treatment discontinuation rates were 12.3% for febuxostat over the five-year follow-up.</p>\n<p>Sensitivity analyses using IPTW and multivariable-adjusted analyses of the unmatched cohort produced results consistent with the primary propensity-matched analyses, with the HFpEF-specific benefit of febuxostat remaining statistically significant in all analytical approaches.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"discussion\">\n<h3>Discussion</h3>\n<p>In this prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study of 2,005 heart failure patients with hyperuricemia followed for five years, we found that uric acid-lowering therapy with febuxostat significantly reduced the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization specifically in patients with HFpEF, with no demonstrable benefit in HFmrEF or HFrEF. The greatest benefits were observed in HFpEF patients with elevated BNP levels and higher serum uric acid concentrations, suggesting that febuxostat may be most effective in the subgroup with the greatest disease burden and the most active uric acid-mediated pathophysiology.</p>\n<p>The phenotype-specific benefit of febuxostat in HFpEF is consistent with the emerging understanding of HFpEF as a cardiometabolic syndrome driven by systemic inflammation and microvascular dysfunction.<sup>13,14</sup> In the HFpEF paradigm proposed by Paulus and Tschope, comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hyperuricemia drive systemic inflammation, which induces coronary microvascular endothelial dysfunction, reduces nitric oxide bioavailability, and promotes myocardial fibrosis and stiffening.<sup>15</sup> Xanthine oxidase, the target of febuxostat, is a major source of reactive oxygen species in the vasculature and myocardium, and its inhibition has been shown to improve endothelial function and reduce markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in clinical studies.<sup>16,17</sup></p>\n<p>The lack of benefit in HFrEF is noteworthy and contrasts with some preclinical data suggesting potential cardioprotective effects of XO inhibition in systolic heart failure. However, our results are consistent with the findings of the EXACT-HF trial, which demonstrated no benefit of allopurinol in patients with HFrEF and hyperuricemia.<sup>18</sup> In HFrEF, the dominant pathophysiology involves cardiomyocyte loss, neurohormonal overactivation, and progressive ventricular dilatation, processes that may not be sufficiently modulated by XO inhibition alone. Furthermore, the extensive evidence-based pharmacotherapy available for HFrEF (including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, beta-blockers, SGLT2 inhibitors, and sacubitril/valsartan) may attenuate any incremental benefit from uric acid-lowering therapy.<sup>19</sup></p>\n<p>The attenuation of febuxostat benefit in HFpEF patients receiving concomitant SGLT2 inhibitor therapy is an intriguing finding that warrants discussion. SGLT2 inhibitors have themselves been shown to reduce SUA levels by approximately 1.0-1.5 mg/dL through enhanced uric acid excretion, and they share some of the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties attributed to XO inhibitors.<sup>20</sup> This mechanistic overlap may explain the diminished incremental benefit of febuxostat in patients already receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, and has implications for the positioning of XO inhibitors in the therapeutic algorithm for HFpEF.</p>\n<p>The improvements observed in functional capacity (6MWD), symptoms (NYHA class), and biomarkers (BNP) among febuxostat-treated HFpEF patients are clinically meaningful and provide supportive evidence for the hard endpoint findings. The reduction in E/e' ratio and left atrial volume index suggests favorable effects on diastolic function and left atrial remodeling, which are central to HFpEF pathophysiology.<sup>21</sup> These functional and structural improvements may reflect the anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects of sustained XO inhibition over the follow-up period.</p>\n<p>From a safety perspective, febuxostat was generally well tolerated over the five-year follow-up period. The initial increase in gout flares during the first three months is a well-recognized phenomenon associated with initiation of uric acid-lowering therapy and can be mitigated with prophylactic colchicine.<sup>22</sup> Importantly, we did not observe an increase in cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke) with febuxostat, which had been a concern following the CARES trial that reported increased cardiovascular mortality with febuxostat compared to allopurinol in gout patients.<sup>23</sup> Our findings are more consistent with the subsequent FAST trial, which found no cardiovascular safety signal for febuxostat.<sup>24</sup></p>\n<p>This study has several limitations. First, as a non-randomized observational study, despite propensity score matching, unmeasured confounding cannot be excluded. The decision to initiate febuxostat may have been influenced by factors not captured in our dataset. Second, the control group was heterogeneous, including patients on no uric acid-lowering therapy and those on allopurinol, which may have diluted between-group differences. Third, the subgroup analyses, while prespecified, should be considered hypothesis-generating given the multiple comparisons performed. Fourth, BNP and NT-proBNP were used interchangeably across sites, which may introduce measurement variability despite the use of standardized conversion factors. Fifth, the study population was predominantly of European descent, and generalizability to other ethnic groups requires confirmation. Sixth, we did not measure direct markers of XO activity, oxidative stress, or AGE formation, which would have strengthened the mechanistic interpretation of our findings.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this five-year observational cohort study demonstrates that febuxostat-based uric acid-lowering therapy is associated with significant reduction in cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization specifically in patients with HFpEF and hyperuricemia, with no benefit observed in HFmrEF or HFrEF. The greatest benefits were observed in HFpEF patients with elevated BNP and serum uric acid levels. These findings support the concept that targeting uric acid-mediated pathways may be a viable therapeutic strategy in HFpEF and provide a strong rationale for randomized controlled trials evaluating febuxostat in this patient population.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol class=\"references-list\">\n<li>GBD 2017 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators.
