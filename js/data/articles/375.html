	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Sudden hearing loss developing after immunisation is a very rare situation. Rabies is a viral disease characterised by encephalitis and death. Treatment involves active and passive immunisation. Neurologic complications including Guillain-Barre syndrome or facial paralysis are reported in the literature as a side effect after rabies immunisation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: Sudden hearing loss was detected in an 11 year-old male patient who had taken the medication for rabies immunisation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study presents a case report of sudden hearing loss developing after rabies immunisation - no other aetiological factors were detected and clinical management is discussed in light of the literature.</p>												        					</div>
