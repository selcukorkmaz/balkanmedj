<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.<sup>1</sup> Since its approval, secukinumab has demonstrated robust efficacy and a generally favorable safety profile across multiple randomized controlled trials.<sup>2,3</sup> Pulmonary adverse events associated with IL-17A inhibitors are exceedingly rare, with only isolated case reports describing interstitial lung disease in the context of other IL-17 pathway inhibitors.<sup>4</sup> Herein, we report a case of secukinumab-induced interstitial pneumonia in a patient with chronic plaque psoriasis, highlighting the importance of vigilance for pulmonary toxicity during biologic therapy.</p>

<h3>Case Presentation</h3>
<p>A 45-year-old male with a 12-year history of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis was initiated on secukinumab (300 mg subcutaneously at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, followed by monthly maintenance dosing) after inadequate response to methotrexate and narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy. The patient had no prior history of pulmonary disease, smoking, occupational exposures, or connective tissue disorders. Baseline chest radiography and routine laboratory investigations were unremarkable. The patient achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 response by week 12 and remained on monthly secukinumab maintenance therapy.</p>
<p>Approximately three months after initiating secukinumab, the patient presented with progressive exertional dyspnea, a nonproductive cough, and low-grade fever (37.8 &deg;C) of two weeks duration. Physical examination revealed bilateral fine inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. Peripheral oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated an elevated C-reactive protein level (48 mg/L; reference &lt;5 mg/L) and a mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (312 U/L; reference 135-225 U/L). Complete blood count, renal function, and liver function tests were within normal limits. Procalcitonin was not elevated (0.08 ng/mL), and sputum cultures, blood cultures, and polymerase chain reaction panels for respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and atypical organisms were negative.</p>
<p>High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest revealed bilateral, predominantly peripheral and basal ground-glass opacities with areas of interlobular septal thickening, consistent with a nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) pattern. There was no evidence of pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, or honeycombing. Pulmonary function testing showed a restrictive pattern with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 68% predicted and a diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 62% predicted. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, revealing a lymphocyte-predominant cellular profile (lymphocytes 38%, macrophages 56%, neutrophils 4%, eosinophils 2%) without evidence of infection or malignant cells. Transbronchial biopsy demonstrated diffuse alveolar septal thickening with lymphocytic infiltration, consistent with organizing pneumonia.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>Secukinumab was immediately discontinued upon suspicion of drug-induced interstitial pneumonia. The patient was initiated on oral prednisolone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day (40 mg daily), which was gradually tapered over 12 weeks. Clinical improvement was noted within the first two weeks, with resolution of dyspnea and cough. Repeat HRCT at 6 weeks demonstrated substantial regression of ground-glass opacities, and at 12 weeks, near-complete resolution was observed. Pulmonary function tests at 12 weeks showed normalization, with FVC recovering to 92% predicted and DLCO to 88% predicted. The patient remained symptom-free at 6-month follow-up without recurrence of pulmonary symptoms.</p>
<p>Given the temporal association between secukinumab initiation and symptom onset, the exclusion of infectious, autoimmune, and environmental etiologies, the consistent radiological and histopathological findings, and the resolution following drug withdrawal, a Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability score of 7 (probable) was assigned.<sup>5</sup> The patient was subsequently transitioned to an IL-23 inhibitor (guselkumab) for psoriasis management, with sustained PASI 75 response at 6-month follow-up and no recurrence of pulmonary symptoms.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>This case illustrates a rare but clinically significant pulmonary adverse event associated with secukinumab therapy. Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) is a recognized complication of numerous pharmacological agents, including biologic therapies; however, its association with IL-17A inhibitors has been minimally documented.<sup>6</sup> The pathophysiology of DILD in this context may involve immune dysregulation consequent to IL-17A blockade. IL-17A plays a complex and context-dependent role in pulmonary immunity, contributing to both pro-inflammatory and tissue-protective functions in the lungs.<sup>7</sup> Inhibition of IL-17A may perturb the balance between protective and pathological immune responses in the pulmonary microenvironment, potentially facilitating aberrant lymphocytic infiltration and alveolar injury.</p>
<p>Notably, interstitial pneumonia has been reported with other biologic agents targeting the IL-17 pathway, including ixekizumab and brodalumab, albeit at very low frequencies.<sup>4,8</sup> A recent pharmacovigilance analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) identified a disproportionality signal for interstitial lung disease with secukinumab, though the absolute number of cases remained small.<sup>9</sup> These observations collectively suggest a class-related susceptibility rather than a drug-specific phenomenon.</p>
<p>Clinicians prescribing IL-17A inhibitors should maintain a high index of suspicion for pulmonary adverse events, particularly in patients presenting with new-onset respiratory symptoms during treatment. Early recognition, prompt drug discontinuation, and initiation of corticosteroid therapy are associated with favorable outcomes, as demonstrated in this case. We recommend baseline pulmonary function assessment and chest radiography prior to initiation of IL-17 inhibitor therapy in patients with pre-existing risk factors for interstitial lung disease, and low-threshold investigation of new respiratory symptoms during treatment.</p>
