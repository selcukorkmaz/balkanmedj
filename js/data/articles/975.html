	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology and is characterized by noncaseating granulomas in organs. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that chronic inflammation may impair arterial function and lead to an increase in arterial pulse wave velocity (PWV) in patients with sarcoidosis.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Methods: </strong>We recruited 19 patients (12 women, 7 men) with sarcoidosis, and 19 sex-matched healthy controls. Aortic PWV was determined by using an automatic device, the Complior Colson (France), which allowed on-line pulse wave recording and automatic calculation of PWV.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: The PWV, glucose, LDL cholesterol, uric acid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were higher in patients with sarcoidosis than in control subjects (p=0.04, p=0.03, p=0.02, p=0.008, p=0.04, p=0.005, respectively). We found significant correlation between PWV and age (p=0.001, r=0.52), body mass index (p=0.01, r=0.40), systolic blood pressure (p&lt;0.001, r=0.71), diastolic blood pressure (p&lt;0.001, r=0.63), mean blood pressure (p&lt;0.001, r=0.68), pulse pressure (p&lt;0.001, r=0.63), pulse transit time (p&lt;0.001, r=-0.90), total cholesterol (p=0.002, r=0.47) and LDL cholesterol (p=0.001, r=0.51).</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The carotid-femoral (aortic) PWV was higher in patients with sarcoidosis than in control subjects. PWV is influenced by total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, age, body-mass index and blood pressure level.</span></p>
