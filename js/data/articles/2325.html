												        						<p><strong>Background</strong>: There are limited data on the long-term outcomes of&nbsp;COVID-19 from different parts of the world.<br /><strong>Aims</strong>: To determine risk factors of 90-day mortality in critically ill&nbsp;patients in Turkish intensive care units (ICUs), with respiratory&nbsp;failure.<br /><strong>Study design</strong>: Retrospective, observational cohort.<br /><strong>Methods</strong>: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and who had&nbsp;been followed up in the ICUs with respiratory failure for more than&nbsp;24 hours were included in the study. Their demographics, clinical characteristics,&nbsp;laboratory variables, treatment protocols, and survival data&nbsp;were recorded.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 421 patients were included. The median age was 67&nbsp;(IQR: 57-76) years, and 251 patients (59.6%) were men.&nbsp;The 90-day&nbsp;mortality rate was 55.1%. The factors independently associated with&nbsp;90-day mortality were invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) (HR&nbsp;4.09 [95% CI: [2.20-7.63], P &lt; .001), lactate level &gt;2 mmol/L (2.78&nbsp;[1.93-4.01], P &lt; .001), age &ge;60 years (2.45 [1.48-4.06)], P &lt; .001),&nbsp;cardiac arrhythmia during ICU stay (2.01 [1.27-3.20], P = .003),&nbsp;vasopressor treatment (1.94 [1.32-2.84], P = .001), positive fluid balance&nbsp;of &ge;600 mL/day (1.68 [1.21-2.34], P = .002), PaO2/FiO2 ratio of&nbsp;&le;150 mmHg (1.66 [1.18-2.32], P = .003), and ECOG score &ge;1 (1.42&nbsp;[1.00-2.02], P = .050).<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Long-term mortality was high in critically ill patients&nbsp;with COVID-19 hospitalized in intensive care units in Turkey. Invasive&nbsp;mechanical ventilation, lactate level, age, cardiac arrhythmia, vasopressor&nbsp;therapy, positive fluid balance, severe hypoxemia and ECOG score were the independent risk factors for 90-day mortality.</p>												        					</div>
