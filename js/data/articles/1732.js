Clinically, amyopathic dermatomyositis is frequently associated with interstitial lung disease, which usually has a rapidly progressive, fatal clinical course. Although clinically, amyopathic dermatomyositis-related interstitial lung disease is well described, data on the histopathology of clinically, amyopathic dermatomyositis-interstitial lung disease are limited. Organising pneumonia and pulmonary vasculitis have rarely been reported.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Case Report</strong>: A 54-year-old Korean woman presented with exertional dyspnoea and a dry cough. Chest computed tomography revealed subpleural ground-glass opacities suggesting interstitial lung disease, which was later pathologically confirmed to be a combination of organising pneumonia and pulmonary vasculitis. The patient improved markedly with prednisone treatment and has remained stable for a long time.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We hereby report a rare combination of organising pneumonia and pulmonary vasculitis in a patient with amyopathic dermatomyositis-interstitial lung disease.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
