	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is a widely-accepted diagnostic modality whose efficacy has been investigated by numerous past studies in the differentiation of malignant lesions from benign entities.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the characterization of renal lesions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Diagnostic accuracy study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: A total of 137 patients with renal lesions were included in this study. The median apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values as well as the b 800 and b 1600 signal intensities of normal kidneys, solid components of mixed renal masses, and total cystic lesions were evaluated.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: There were significant differences between the ADC values of lesions and normal renal parenchyma, and between the ADC values of benign and malignant renal lesions on DWIs at b values of 800 and 1600 s/mm&sup2; (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). There were significant differences between the ADC values of Bosniak Category 1 and 2 cysts and the ADC values of Bosniak Category 1 and 3 cysts on DWIs at b values of 800 s/mm&sup2; (p&lt;0.001) and 1600 s/mm2 (p&lt;0.001). A cutoff value of 1.902 x 10-3 mm&sup2;/s for the ADC with a b value of 800 s/mm&sup2; provided 88% sensitivity and 96% specificity for differentiation between benign and malignant renal lesions. A cutoff value of 1.623 x 10-3 mm&sup2;/s for the ADC with a b value of 1600 s/mm&sup2; provided 79% sensitivity and 96% specificity (p&lt;0.001) for the differentiation between benign and malignant renal lesions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Accurate assessment of renal masses is important for determining the necessity for surgical intervention. DWI provides additional value by differentiating benign from malignant renal tumors and can be added to routine kidney MRI protocols.</p>
