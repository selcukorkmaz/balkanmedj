	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The increase in symmetric (SDMA) and asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) is associated with endothelial dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of exercise on ADMA and SDMA levels and related ratios in type 2 DM.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Thirty-six women with type 2 DM and 44 healthy women were recruited to the study. Fourteen and 19 subjects, respectively, attended four-weeks of moderate intensity exercise. Plasma SDMA, ADMA, and L-arginine levels were measured by the HPLC method initially, after the first exercise session, and after one month.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: All measurements were within the normal range in both groups and did not change significantly immediately after exercise and after the first month. In the healthy group, L-arginine/ADMA and L-arginine/SDMA ratios after one month were significantly higher than the initial values (p&lt;0.022 and p=0.017, respectively). After one month of exercise, L-arginine/ADMA and L-arginine/SDMA ratios increased in diabetics and decreased in healthy subjects when compared to those after the first exercise session (p=0.026 and p=0.037, respectively).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We suggest that L-arginine/ADMA and L-arginine/SDMA ratios should be used in spite of absolute values. These molecules have a substantial role in the beneficial effects of exercise in healthy subjects while their role is small in diabetics.</p>
