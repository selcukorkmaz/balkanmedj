	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Achilles tendon ruptures are characterized by a long recovery period, high re-rupture rate and late return to work. To overcome these difficulties and augment tendon repair, many agents have been used.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: To determine the effect of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures in rabbits.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study&nbsp;Design</strong>: Animal experimentation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: The study included 14 New Zealand albino rabbits that were divided randomly into 2 groups, A and B, each containing seven rabbits. On day zero, all 28 Achilles tendons were tenotomized and repaired. In group A, the tendons were injected with PRP post-surgery, whereas those in group B were left untreated. On day 28, the right tendons in both groups were examined histopathologically via both light and electron microscopy, and the left tendons were subjected to biomechanical testing.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The histological and biomechanical findings in both light and electron microscopy in group A were better than those in group B, but the difference was not significant. According to Tang&rsquo;s scale, the mean value in Group A was 3.57, while it was 3.0 in Group B. The mean value of Group A for the length of collagen bands was 48.09 nm while the mean value of Group B was 46.58 nm (p=0.406). In biomechanical tests, although stiffness values were higher in group A, the difference between groups was not significant. In addition, maximum load values did not differ between groups A and B.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: PRP had no effect on the healing process 28 days post-Achilles tendon rupture.</p>
