	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: The scar tissue formed by episiotomy during vaginal delivery, and the related pain, is very frequent. The change in the normal anatomy can cause cosmetic and physiologic problems. It can affect and cause deterioration in sexual functions. Therefore, making the right diagnosis and applying the right surgical procedures are very important.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: Our aim was to examine the effect of the perineoplasty operation on the sexual dysfunctions that present due to vaginal delivery.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Self-controlled study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Forty patients, who attended our clinic between April 2012 and May 2013, and who were between the ages of 20 and 50 years, were included in the study. The patients had complaints of scar tissue in the perineum and various sexual dysfunctions after vaginal delivery, and they were suitable for perineoplasty. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire was applied to the patients before and 6 months after the operation, and the results were compared.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: After the perineoplasty operation, there was a statistically significant improvement in the patients in the domains of sexual desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, and sexual satisfaction (p&lt;0.005). However, there was no significant improvement in the feeling of pain during sexual intercourse (p=0.184). The mean&plusmn;SD total FSFI score increased significantly after the operation (p&lt;0.005).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The sexual dysfunctions that develop due to perineal damage during vaginal delivery can benefit significantly from the perineoplasty operation if the indications are correct. However, vaginal perineoplasty did not provide an improvement in dyspareunia.</p>
