	<strong>Background:</strong> Several recent studies have suggested that 1 minus-forced expiratory volume expired in 3 seconds / forced vital capacity (1-FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC) may be an indicator of distal airway obstruction and a promising measure to evaluate small airways dysfunction.<br />
	<strong>Aims:</strong> To investigate the associations of 1-FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC with the spirometric measures and lung volumes that assess small airways dysfunction and reflects hyperinflation and air trapping.<br />
	<strong>Study Design:</strong> Retrospective cross-sectional study.<br />
	<strong>Methods: </strong>Retrospective assessment of a total of 1110 cases who underwent body plethysmographic lung volume estimations between a time span from 2005 to 2012. Patients were assigned into two groups: firstly by FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &lt;70% vs. FEV1/FVC &ge;70%); secondly by FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC &lt; lower limits of normal (LLN) (FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC &lt; LLN vs. FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC &ge; LLN). Spirometric indices and lung volumes measured by whole-body plethysmography were compared in groups. Also the correlation of spirometric indices with measured lung volumes were assessed in the whole-study population and in subgroups stratified according to FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC and FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC.<br />
	<strong>Results: </strong>Six hundred seven (54.7%) were male and 503 (45.3%) were female, with a mean age of 52.5&plusmn;15.6 years. Mean FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC and 1-FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC were 87.05%, 12.95%, respectively. The mean 1-FEV3/FVC was 4.9% in the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &ge;70% group (n=644) vs. 24.1% in the FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &lt;70% group (n=466). A positive correlation was found between 1-FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC and residual volume (r=0.70; p&lt;0.0001), functional residual capacity-pleth (r=0.61; p&lt;0.0001), and total lung capacity (r=0.47; p&lt;0.0001). 1-FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC was negatively correlated with forced expiratory flow<sub>25-75</sub> (r=&minus;0.84; p&lt;0.0001). The upper limit of 95% confidence interval for 1-FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC was 13.7%. 1-FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC showed significant correlations with parameters of air trapping and hyperinflation measured by whole-body plethysmography. Importantly, these correlations were higher in study participants with FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &lt;70% or FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC &lt; LLN compared to those with FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC &ge;70% or FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC &ge; LLN, respectively.<br />
	<strong>Conclusion: </strong>1-FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC can be easily calculated from routine spirometric measurements. 1-FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC is a promising marker of air trapping and hyperinflation. We suggest that 1-FEV<sub>3</sub>/FVC is complementary to FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC and recommend clinicians to routinely report and evaluate together with FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC during spirometry.</p>
