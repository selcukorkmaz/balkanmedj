Patients were randomly divided into two groups; group 1 received intravenous methylprednisolone+IV theophylline and group 2 intravenous methylprednisolone+placebo for 5 days. PFT and EDSS score were repeated and blood was taken for TNF-alpha on the 5th and 30th days of the treatment.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-four patients (14 female, 10 male) were included in the study. Mean age was 32.6&plusmn;9, duration of disease was 5.4&plusmn;4.2 years, number of exacerbations was 5&plusmn;2. There was a significant correlation between the number of exacerbations and EDSS score (p=0.000, r=1). Restrictive PFT findings were detected in 8 and decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) in 3 cases. In within-group analysis, EDSS score was found to be decreased on day 5 and still low on day 30 in the theophylline group (baseline 3&plusmn;1.3; 5th day 2.4&plusmn;1.6; 30th day 2&plusmn;1.7). There was no statistically significant difference in the EDSS score of the placebo group (3&plusmn;1.6; 2.8&plusmn;1.7; 2.4&plusmn;1.9 respectively). While serum TNF-alpha level was not changed in the placebo group, there was a non-significant decrease on day 5 and increase on day 30 in the theophylline group. There was no correlation between the clinical parameters, PFT and TNF-alpha level.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: There was no correlation between severity of MS and PFT findings. It is suggested that theophylline might be effective in MS exacerbations since it caused decreases in clinical scores; studies with longer treatment duration are needed to clarify its possible anti-inflammatory effect.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
