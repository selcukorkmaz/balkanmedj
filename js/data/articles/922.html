	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: There is a lack of data comparing antifungal susceptibilities of Candida isolates in candidemic newborns weighing &le;1500 g versus those weighing &gt;1500 g. This study aims to compare antifungal susceptibilities of newborns according to their birth weights.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: All candidemic newborns assessed retrospectively. Candida species were identified using the API 20C AUX system. In vitro susceptibility of isolates for fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole and amphotericine B were determined using the E-test and the broth macrodilution method. Clinical backgrounds of patients were also examined.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: Of 2700 newborns admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit in years 2001-2002, 375 (14%) were &lt;1500 g. Forty five (1.7%) of all infants developed candidemia. Nineteen were in Group 1, 26 were in Group 2. As possible risk factors, mean length of ventilation and catheter days were greater in Group 2. All Candida species yielded from Group 1 were more susceptible to antifungal drugs. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 and 90 values of non-albicans strains were almost always higher in Group 2.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this study, Candida species were more susceptible in the newborns weighing &lt;1500 g. We believe this situation is related to less number of possible risk factors for the newborns weighing &lt;1500 g.</span></p>
