<p>
	Leucocytoclastic vasculitis is a heterogeneous group of disorders with various factors responsible in its etiology. It can be observed as a paraneoplastic phenomenon in patients with malignancies. Here we report a 68 year old male with T cell rich B cell non- Hodgkin lymphoma, who had diffuse plaque-type rashes on his back, abdomen, chest wall, and extremities due to leucocytoclastic vasculitis of the skin. He received chemotherapy and mini mantle radiotherapy. Cutaneous findings of the patient resolved completely with the remission of the primary disease. Skin rashes in patients with malignancies may be due to primary tumor involvement or secondary to vasculitis. Histopathological examination of affected tissue specimen is helpful to distinguish secondary vasculitis from primary tumor metastasis.</p>
