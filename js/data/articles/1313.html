	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We evaluated the functional results of patients who were treated with closed reduction and external fixation for proximal humeral fractures.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods: </strong>The study included16 patients (11 males, 5 females; mean age 50.3 years; range 9 to 81 years) with proximal humerus fractures. All the patients were treated with closed reduction and external fixation (9 İlizarov external fixator, 7 monolateral external fixator). After bone union was achieved, the fixators were removed and functional results were evaluated with the Constant score. The mean follow-up was 37 months (range 4 to 69 months).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The average union time was 14 weeks (range 8 to 22 weeks). Union did not occur in one patient. Avascular necrosis of the humeral head developed in one patient. Superficial pin tract infections were observed in three patients, all of whom were successfully treated with wound care and antibiotic therapy. The mean Constant score was 81.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Treatment of displaced fractures of the proximal humerus with closed reduction and external fixation provides satisfactory fracture reduction and stability and functional results.</p>
