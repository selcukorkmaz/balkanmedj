												        						<p><strong>Background</strong>: There is no consensus on the optimal drainage technique&nbsp;in the management of biliary anastomotic strictures occurring after&nbsp;right-lobe living-donor liver transplantation (RL LDLT).<br /><strong>Aims</strong>: To investigate whether there is a superiority between unilateral&nbsp;and bilateral drainage groups in terms of efficacy and safety of&nbsp;biliary drainage in RL LDLT patients undergoing double-biliary&nbsp;reconstruction.<br /><strong>Study Design</strong>: Retrospective Cohort<br /><strong>Methods</strong>: Between January 2009 and August 2019, 1693 patients&nbsp;underwent RL LDLT. Of these, 182 patients who developed biliary&nbsp;anastomotic strictures out of the 306 patients who had double-biliary reconstruction, were included in the study. One hundred fifty-five&nbsp;patients with technical success were divided into 2 groups as unilateral&nbsp;(n=116) and bilateral (n=39) drainage groups. The groups were compared&nbsp;in terms of variable parameters such as clinical success, additional&nbsp;procedure, post-ERCP complication, procedures after clinical&nbsp;failure, hospital stay, mortality, and survival.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: The clinical success was higher in the bilateral group (70% vs.&nbsp;82%, P = .201). In the initial and the follow-up periods, a total of 44&nbsp;(38%) patients in the unilateral group were switched to the bilateral&nbsp;drainage group due to the increased need for stenting. The placement&nbsp;of a stent successfully solved the problem only in 28% (32/117) of&nbsp;the patients in the unilateral group, while this rate was 44% (17/39)&nbsp;in the bilateral group. The median follow-up time of both groups was&nbsp;42 months, and was equal. The number of stent-free follow-up patients&nbsp;in the unilateral drainage group was less than that in the bilateral drainage&nbsp;group (4 and 7, respectively).<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: An active attempt should be made for bilateral drainage&nbsp;in patients with biliary anastomotic stricture following RL LDLT.&nbsp;However, for patients in whom bilateral drainage is not possible, unilateral&nbsp;drainage may be recommended, with the placement of a maximum&nbsp;number of stents following primary biliary balloon dilatation, depending&nbsp;on the degree of stricture.</p>												        					</div>
