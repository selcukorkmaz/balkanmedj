	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: The clinical significance of maxillary sinus mucosal cysts in liver and kidney transplant recipients remains unclear.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aimp</strong>: To investigate the course of maxillary mucosal cysts in liver and kidney transplantation patients.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Retrospective clinical study</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Paranasal sinus computed tomography scans of 169 renal and 43 hepatic transplant recipients were reviewed. The incidence, size and growth characteristics of maxillary mucosal cysts in the renal and hepatic transplant population were noted.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Overall incidence of maxillary sinus mucosal cyst in transplantation patients was found to be 24.5%, with a male to female ratio of 2:1 (p&lt;0.05). Follow-up views of 26 patients showed that the size of the cysts increased in 19, decreased in 4, and remained the same in 3 patients. Mean growth rate of the cysts was calculated to be 6.30 &plusmn; 7.02 mm2 per month. Most of the cysts were located on the inferior wall of the maxillary sinus.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Incidence of the maxillary mucosal cysts in renal and hepatic transplant recipients does not differ from general population, but these cysts have a greater tendency to grow. Specific measures are not needed for isolated, asymptomatic maxillary mucosal cysts in transplant populations.</p>
