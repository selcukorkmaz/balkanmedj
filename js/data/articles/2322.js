An early age of onset, a family history supporting autosomaldominant&nbsp;inheritance, insulin resistance, and the absence of autoimmunity&nbsp;are the major characteristics of MODY. However, genetic testing&nbsp;is crucial for diagnosis.<br /><strong>Aims</strong>: To investigate the 7 MODY-related genes and clinical findings&nbsp;of patients with a preliminary clinical diagnosis of MODY.<br /><strong>Study Design</strong>: Retrospective cross-sectional study.<br /><strong>Methods</strong>: In this study, 7 genes (KCNJ11, ABCC8, INS, GCK,&nbsp;HNF4A, HNF1A, and HNF1B) related to MODY were screened via&nbsp;targeted sequencing in 182 cases with a confirmed pre-diagnosis of&nbsp;MODY. The clinical characteristics of the patients were evaluated&nbsp;retrospectively.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: A total of 182 patients, 48% of whom were women, between the&nbsp;ages of 18-62 were included in the study. In 30 cases (16.4%), 28 different&nbsp;pathogenic variations were found, of which 20 were previously reported&nbsp;and 8 were novel variations segregated by disease within the family.&nbsp;Pathogenic variations were detected in the following genes in order of&nbsp;mutation frequency; GCK, HNF1A, ABCC8, HNF4A, HNF1B and KCNJ11.&nbsp;Interestingly, six of the 30 cases (20%) carried a pathogenic variation in&nbsp;the ABCC8 gene. No mutation was detected in the INS gene. A family&nbsp;history of vertically transmitted diabetes and elevated HbA1C at the time&nbsp;of diagnosis were found in 20 (66%) and 16 (52%) cases, respectively.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this series, 28 different pathogenic variations are&nbsp;identified,&nbsp;8 of which are novel. The rate of pathogenic variation in the&nbsp;ABCC8 gene is unexpectedly high. Two-thirds of cases have a family&nbsp;history of vertically transmitted diabetes.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
