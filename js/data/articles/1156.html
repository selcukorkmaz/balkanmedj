	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Our study aimed to assess the diagnostic capabilities of mangafodipir trisodium (Mn-DPDP)- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for the evaluation of pancreatic malign mass.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Magnetic resonance images of 17 patients (7 females, 10 males; mean age 63.2&plusmn;12 years; range 36 to 80 years) suspected of pancreatic tumor by abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography findings, were examined in terms of signal to noise (S/N) and contrast to noise (C/N) ratios before and after administration of Mn-DPDP using T1 A SE, Fat Sat T1 A SE and GRE T1 A sequences.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Before and after administration of Mn-DPDP, the increase in S/N ratios of normal pancreatic parenchyma were found as 22.81%, 32.88% and 20% in T1 A SE, Fat Sat T1 A SE and GRE T1 A sequences, respectively. The increase in C/N ratios obtained from signal intensity values of normal pancreatic tissue and tumor were found as 58.69%, 125.41% and 62.06% in T1 A SE, Fat Sat T1 A SE and GRE T1 A sequences, respectively. Furthermore, in all sequences, before and after contrast medium administration, the increase of C/N ratios were found statistically significant (paired Student&#39;s t test, p&lt;0.0001).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The differences of C/N ratio using Mn-DPDP as a contrast agent may contribute to the diagnosis of pancreatic malign masses.</p>
