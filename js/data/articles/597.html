	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of this study is to evaluate the possible protective effects of curcumin against cholestatic oxidative stress and liver damage in common bile duct ligated rats.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: A total of 18 male Wistar albino rats were divided into three groups: control, common bile duct ligation (BDL) and BDL+curcumin. Each group contained 6 animals. The rats in the curcumin treated group were given curcumin (100 mg/kg) once a day orally for 14 days, starting 3 days prior to BDL operation. Following 14 days of treatment, all the animals were decapitated and liver tissue samples were obtained for histopathological investigation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The changes demonstrating the bile duct proliferation and fibrosis in expanded portal tracts, including the extension of proliferated bile ducts into lobules, mononuclear cells, and neutrophil infiltration into the widened portal areas, were observed in BDL group. Treatment of BDL with curcumin attenuated liver damage. Both the elevated alpha smooth muscle actin (&alpha;-SMA), and the activity of TUNEL in the BDL were observed to be reduced with the curcumin treatment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our data indicate that curcumin reduced BDL-induced cholestatic liver injury, bile duct proliferation, fibrosis.</p>
