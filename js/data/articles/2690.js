The intricate anatomy of this region, which contains essential neurovascular structures and delicate cranial nerves, presents significant surgical challenges.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>In recent decades, major advancements have transformed skull base surgery, leading to improved patient outcomes and quality of life.<sup>2</sup> This progress has been driven by technological innovations, a deeper understanding of anatomy, and enhanced multidisciplinary collaboration. Endoscopic techniques offer superior visualization, allowing surgeons to navigate complex anatomical structures with greater precision.<sup>3-5</sup> Furthermore, intraoperative imaging modalities such as 3D ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) improve surgical accuracy, reducing complications and enhancing patient safety. Navigation systems and indocyanine green angiography have also contributed to greater surgical precision, further optimizing outcomes.<sup>6-8</sup></p>\r\n<p>The incorporation of personalized medicine is set to further advance skull base surgery. Developments in imaging, genomics, and artificial intelligence (AI) are enabling more individualized treatment approaches. AI-driven image analysis can improve preoperative planning by predicting tumor behavior and optimizing surgical pathways. Intraoperative AI-assisted decision-making may soon facilitate real-time surgical adjustments, enhancing precision and shortening the learning curve for complex procedures.<sup>9-11</sup> Customizing surgical techniques based on a patient&rsquo;s specific anatomical and pathological characteristics is no longer a distant possibility but an emerging reality.</p>\r\n<p>Robotic-assisted surgery represents a growing advancement in skull base procedures, extending the capabilities of minimally invasive techniques and enhancing dexterity in deep, previously inaccessible regions. As robotic systems become more advanced, their role in skull base surgery is expected to expand further. If newly developed robotic systems can overcome challenges such as maneuverability constraints in narrow spaces like the nasal cavity, lack of tactile feedback, and integration with imaging and navigation systems, their use in this field will likely increase.<sup>12,13</sup></p>\r\n<p>The adoption of advanced 3D modeling technologies is transforming preoperative planning and training in skull base surgery. By collaborating with neuroradiologists and engineers, surgeons can generate anatomically precise models derived from computed tomography and MRI images, enabling them to simulate procedures and refine surgical techniques before operating.<sup>14</sup> Additionally, virtual reality simulations provide immersive training experiences that enhance surgical education and improve overall procedural quality.<sup>6,15</sup></p>\r\n<p>Multidisciplinary collaboration remains fundamental to skull base surgery. The combined expertise of otolaryngologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and oncologists is essential for providing comprehensive patient care. As subspecialization continues to grow, fostering effective teamwork and shared decision-making will be crucial to optimizing patient outcomes.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>Looking ahead, the future of skull base surgery will likely be shaped by ongoing technological advancements, personalized surgical strategies, and greater AI integration. While technology expands surgical capabilities, the core principles of skull base surgery remain unchanged: a deep understanding of human anatomy, precise surgical technique, and the ability to navigate complex procedures with skill, evidence-based practice, and multidisciplinary collaboration.</p>\r\n<p>As we adopt these innovations, it is essential to ensure that technological reliance does not diminish the fundamental surgical expertise that defines the field. No algorithm can replicate a surgeon&rsquo;s intuition, nuanced intraoperative decision-making, or the patient-centered approach that ensures compassionate care. The successful integration of these advancements will depend not only on their technological refinement but also on how surgeons adapt and apply them in clinical practice.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Authorship Contributions:</strong> Concept- A.V., M.F.; Design- A.V., M.F.; Data Collection or Processing- A.V., M.F.; Analysis or Interpretation- A.V., M.F.; Literature Search- A.V., M.F.; Writing- A.V., M.F.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> No conflict of interest was declared by the authors.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"reference\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Reference</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<h3><strong>REFERENCES</strong></h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Vural A.
