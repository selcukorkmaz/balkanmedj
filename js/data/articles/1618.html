	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The range of motion (ROM) of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb on abduction and opposition were studied in normal individuals.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: The study included 40 volunteer medical students (20 males, 20 females; mean age 22.5 years). The range of motion of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb was measured with the use of a digital inclinometer on abduction and opposition. The highest value obtained from three measurements was taken into account. Dominant and non-dominant thumbs were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The mean range of motion of the carpometacarpal joint of the thumb was found as 52.6 degrees on abduction, and 37.6 degrees on opposition. No significant differences were found between dominant and non-dominant thumbs in both sexes.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The range of motion of the thumb in Turkish individuals was found consistent with average ranges reported in the literature.</p>
