HL comprises 1% of all cancer cases and 14% of all lymphoma cases.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: We designed a retrospective study to investigate the clinical features and prognostic factors of HL patients diagnosed at an experienced oncology centre.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Retrospective study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: Demographic characteristics, histopathological and clinical features, treatment modalities and response to treatment were obtained from hospital records. Dates of initial diagnosis, remission and relapse, last visit and death were recorded for survival analyses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: We analysed data of 391 HL patients (61% male, 39% female; mean age 35.7&plusmn;15.1 years). The most common classical HL histological subtype was nodular sclerosing HL (NSHL) (42.7%). The most common stage was II 50.4%. The most common chemotherapy regimen was doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD) (70.6%). Five and 10-year survival rates were 90% and 84%, respectively. Early-stage patients with good prognostic factors had better overall and relapse-free survival rates. The presence of &ldquo;B&rdquo; symptoms, albumin level, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score, and LDH were prognostic factors that affect the survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the first study that demonstrates the demographic, clinical and prognostic features of HL patients in Turkey, and provides a general picture of the HL patients in our country.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
