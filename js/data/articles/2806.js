She had no history of head trauma, previous surgery, or connective tissue disorder. On examination, she had marked conjunctival chemosis and proptosis of the left eye with dilated, tortuous episcleral vessels (Figure 1a). Visual acuity was 20/40 in the left eye and 20/20 in the right eye. Intraocular pressure was elevated at 28 mmHg on the left side. A continuous bruit was audible over the left orbit on auscultation. Extraocular movements were mildly restricted in lateral gaze. The right eye examination was unremarkable.</p>\n<p>Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the head revealed a dilated left superior ophthalmic vein and an enlarged left cavernous sinus with early venous opacification, consistent with a low-flow indirect carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (Barrow type D) (Figure 1b). No direct communication between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus was identified. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the findings and demonstrated mild proptosis with thickening of the left lateral rectus muscle.</p>\n<p>Given the low-flow nature of the fistula and the absence of cortical venous drainage or threatened visual loss, a conservative management strategy was initially adopted. The patient was instructed to perform external manual compression of the ipsilateral carotid artery using the contralateral hand for 10-second intervals, repeated 4 to 6 times per hour during waking hours, with careful avoidance of simultaneous bilateral compression. She was educated about the rationale of the technique, which aims to reduce arterial inflow to the cavernous sinus and promote spontaneous thrombosis of the fistula.</p>\n<p>At the 6-week follow-up, the patient reported subjective improvement in the orbital symptoms. Clinical examination demonstrated significant reduction in chemosis and proptosis. The orbital bruit was no longer auscultable. Intraocular pressure had normalized to 16 mmHg. Repeat CTA at 3 months confirmed complete resolution of the fistula, with normalization of the caliber of the superior ophthalmic vein and cavernous sinus (Figure 1c). At the 6-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with stable visual acuity and no evidence of recurrence.</p>\n<p>Indirect carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas are abnormal arteriovenous communications between the meningeal branches of the carotid arteries and the cavernous sinus. They typically present with the classic triad of chemosis, proptosis, and orbital bruit. Unlike direct fistulas, which usually result from trauma and require endovascular intervention, low-flow indirect fistulas may resolve spontaneously or with conservative measures. External manual carotid compression, first described by Higashida et al., has been reported to achieve fistula closure in approximately 30% of cases of indirect carotid-cavernous fistulas. This simple, noninvasive technique should be considered as a first-line approach in patients with low-flow fistulas without cortical venous drainage, vision-threatening complications, or intolerable symptoms, reserving endovascular embolization for refractory cases.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol class=\"references-list\">\n<li>Barrow DL, Spector RH, Braun IF, Landman JA, Tindall SC, Tindall GT.
