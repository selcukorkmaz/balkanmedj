	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Percutaneous tracheotomy is a relatively new technique which is considered as an alternative to conventional tracheotomy. While both techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages, the data related to long-term follow-up after percutaneous dilational tracheotomy (PDT) and its late complications are limited in the literature. The aim of this study is to compare both techniques according to the complications, patients&#39; epidemiological situations, intubation duration, coagulopathy, mortality rates and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: We retrospectively evaluated 236 tracheotomy cases perfomed at our hospital between 1995-2007.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: There was statistically significant difference in complication rates between open and percutaneous tracheotomy techniques (p=0.001). Major complications (TOF, tracheal stenosis, hemorrhage) were mostly related to PDT. However, stomal infection, stomal granulation tissue formation and cannula obstruction due to mucoid debris was more frequent in the open technique group. The mortality rate was found to be higher in the PDT group. Positive bacterial cultures on deep tracheal aspirations were significantly increasing the complication rates. Open technique costs were nearly twice that of percutaneous technique.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Major complications are more common with percutaneous tracheotomy compared to open technique tracheotomy according to our study results. Since in some cases PDT may necessarily be converted into an open technique; a surgically talented and equipped staff should perform this method.</span></p>
