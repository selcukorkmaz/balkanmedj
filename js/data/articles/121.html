	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Background</strong>: Contrast enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiography is a novel technique and promising method in demonstrating biliary tree anatomy and evaluating biliary disorders. However, to date, there are a limited number of studies that have focused on the impact of this technique.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Aims</strong>: We aimed to evaluate the additional role of contrast enhanced MR cholangiography (MRC) and compare contrast enhanced MRC with T2-weighted (w) magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in the diagnosis of biliary disorders.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Diagnostic accuracy study.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Methods</strong>: The T2w-MRCP and contrast enhanced MRC sequences of 31 patients whose gold standard test results were available were scored visually for the existence of pathological findings with regard to any of the biliary diseases. Gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA) was used as the contrast agent. The correlation values were determined according to the statistical analysis made from those scores and the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values of each sequence were detected as well.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Results</strong>: We detected that the correlation values with gold standard methods of contrast enhanced MRC sequences were significantly higher than the ones of T2w-MRCP sequences. The correlation ratios of T2w-MRCP sequences were between 26 and 34%, while those for contrast enhanced MRC sequences were between 81 and 83% for the first reader and the correlation ratios of T2w-MRCP sequences were between 10 and 61%, whereas those of contrast enhanced MRC were between 79 and 81% for the second reader The mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values of T2w-MRCP sequences were 14.3-42.5%, 85-89.2% and 59.3-72.5%, respectively, while the mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values of contrast enhanced MRC sequences were 100%, 86.7% and 93.2-93.3%, respectively.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We suggest that obtaining of contrast enhanced MRC sequences in addition to the T2w-MRCP can be useful in the diagnosis of many diseases in relation with biliary tree.</p>
