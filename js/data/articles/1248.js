This ion transport system mediates sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Increased activity of Na+/H+ exchanger was found in the cells of patients with arterial hypertension in different populations. We investigated this polymorphism in a Turkish group of patients with hypertension and compared them with normotensive subjects.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: 99 hypertensive patients (57 males, 42 females) and 45 normotensive controls (33 males, 12 females) were genotyped for the GNB3 C825T polymorphism.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Allele distribution of patient and control groups were CC: 35, CT: 51, TT: 13 and CC: 26, CT: 15, TT: 4, respectively. T-allele carriers (CT and TT) were significantly higher in hypertensive group. There was also a statistically significant (Chi-square test, p=0.041) relationship between 825T allele and hypertension.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results suggest that hypertension is related with GNB3 polymorphism in Turkish patients and increased G protein activity may be the pathophysiologic link between C825T and hypertension.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
