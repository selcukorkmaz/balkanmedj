In these samples, pH, lactate, SO2, pO2, pCO2, HCO3 values were measured and their means were compared.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: While there were no significant differences between the pH, pO2 and SO2 levels of venous samples from brachial vein and pampiniform plexus, lactate level was significantly higher, pCO2 and HCO3 levels were significantly lower. Despite these significant differences, mean values measured were within normal laboratory ranges.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although the results of this study showed that varicocele caused statistically significant decreases in the rate of oxygen consumption and metabolism level in the testis tissue compared with the peripheral tissues, values obtained from the venous sample of pampiniform plexus were normal. Therefore, diminished oxygen consumption and decreased metabolism can not explain the negative effects of varicocele on testis tissue.This topic remains to be elucidated in later studies</span></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
