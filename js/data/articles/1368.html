	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Hydatid cyst disease mostly involves the liver and the lung. The spleen is one of the rare sites involved in hydatid cyst disease. The clinical presentation of the splenic hydatid cyst disease is often vague. Two cases of hydatidosis with isolated spleen involvement which were treated surgically are reported. The two patients who presented with mild abdominal discomfort, swelling, being full up quickly, were diagnosed as primary splenic hydatid cyst by ultrasonography and CT scans. Both of the patients underwent splenectomy, partial diaphragm resection and left tube thoracostomy. Both of them followed an uneventful early postoperative course and discharged from the hospital on the 6th and 18th days following the operation, respectively. One of the patients died at his home four days after his discharge, the other is under control for 24 months without an event.</p>
