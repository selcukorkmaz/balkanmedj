	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Inflammatory fibroid polyp is a rare benign lesion that most frequently originates from the gastric antrum, but can also be seen in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Differential diagnosis includes gastrointestinal polyps and polypoid stromal tumors due to their polypoid appearance on gross examination, and microscopically, various malignant and benign stromal tumors, primarily gastrointestinal stromal tumors. We presented a 51-year-old female patient who was referred to our center with a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma made after an endoscopic biopsy, but found to have an inflammatory fibroid polyp located in the antrum after distal subtotal gastrectomy.</p>
