	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Several studies have shown that many stroke survivors experience a decline in their Quality of life (QOL) in terms of impaired physical, functional, psychological, and social health. Quality of life is most often assessed by means of either structured interviews or written questionnaires. Many questionnaires have been developed recently for the evaluation of QOL in stroke and many studies have been done on this subject. In this study QOL changes in stroke patients, the evaluation of QOL, the QOL measuring instruments and the results of clinical studies on the subject were discussed.</p>
