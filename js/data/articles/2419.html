<p>The post-COVID-19 condition, also known as long COVID, threatens to be a pandemic within the pandemic. Affected patients include adults, children, and adolescents who have new or ongoing symptoms &ge;4 weeks after the start of acute COVID-19.<sup>1</sup> COVID-19 pneumonia at hospital admission, intensive care stay, older age, and female sex are poor prognostic markers for the post-COVID-19 condition.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>This can jeopardize global health and economic recovery and may represent an emerging public health concern. In the United Kingdom (UK) alone, 2.1% (1.3 million) of the population developed the post-COVID-19 condition so far.<sup>3</sup> In a cross-sectional observational study of 89 acute COVID-19 survivors from the UK, nearly 50% of them still had long COVID symptoms during the 9-month survey. Over 33% of our patient cohort had multiple long COVID symptoms.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Epidemiology studies in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are lacking. Since the post-COVID-19 condition is not fully understood and uncertainties are still present about its pathophysiology, many LMICs have not implemented robust strategies to deal with the negative consequences of this condition.</p>
<p>Several challenges are identified in delivering holistic care to post-COVID-19 condition sufferers in LMICs. One of the challenges is in identifying patients&rsquo; symptoms owing to the general public and health care providers&rsquo; lack of awareness of the condition.<sup>5</sup> Another stumbling block is correctly attributing the patient&rsquo;s symptoms to the post-COVID-19 condition, which has many mimickers.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>We urge LMICs to learn from the UK&rsquo;s model to deliver long COVID care and consider implementing a holistic approach to this disabling condition.</p>
<p>Setting up a multidisciplinary approach to establishing COVID-19 recovery programs to support, expand, and provide access to pulmonary rehabilitation is critical in tackling the physical and mental aspects of post-COVID-19 condition. Specialist medical society support is mandatory, e.g., taking a leaf out of the recommendations by the British Thoracic Society guidelines for patients experiencing persistent problems with respiratory symptoms after COVID-19 and highlighting support mechanisms and, finally, the importance of community support that occurs through peer-to-peer community and COVID-19 online support groups.</p>
<p>Raising awareness, identification, public health information campaign, education, research, and multidisciplinary and multipronged health department coordination may be the cornerstones in the efficient management of the long-term effects of COVID-19 in vast and resource-stretched healthcare systems found in LMICs. Covering health needs in LMICs with a large population may be an expensive exercise that can stretch the resources. However, the loss of workforce due to the debilitating post-COVID-19 condition may impede health and economic recovery, with the ramifications potentially costing more than the expenditure spent to improve the health and well-being of these individuals.</p>
<p>We hope that the World Health Organization will take the initiative to assess the scale of the problem, negotiate, and implement a road map for patients with long COVID in LMICs, which is a need of the hour!</p>
