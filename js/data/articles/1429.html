	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We assessed the effect of linear polarized polychromatic light (LPPL) on the healing of pressure ulcers.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Forty patients with grade II or grade III pressure ulcers were randomly assigned to LPPL or conventional therapies. All wound surfaces were cleaned using physiologic serum and dressed with antibacterial pomade. Linear polarized polychromatic light was applied directly through the skin with the Biolamp device, at a dose of 1.3 J/cm2 for 6 minutes daily from a distance of 10 cm. Ulcer area measurements were calculated as square centimeters on a graph paper at baseline and on the seventh and 15th days of treatment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Comparisons of mean wound areas within each group showed significant improvements on the seventh and 15th days of treatment (p&lt;0.05). However, it was noted that healing of larger wound areas was faster and more effective in patients treated with LPPL.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results suggest that LPPL is more effective in treating grade II and grade III pressure wounds.</p>
