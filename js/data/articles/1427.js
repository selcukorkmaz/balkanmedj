Gastrointestinal (14.3%), urological, intracranial, and breast malignancies (4.8%) were less common. Fifteen patients had a malignancy before hospitalization. On admission, a gynecological malignancy was diagnosed in six patients (3%) with APUSG. The mean age of patients with a malignancy was 57&plusmn;10 (35-72 years), with a male to female ratio of 10/11. Gynecological malignancies involved the uterus (n=4), ovary (n=2), and vulva (n=1). All gastrointestinal system malignancies were in the colon. Of urological malignancies, two were of renal localization (hypernephroma) and one was in the prostate gland. Lung malignancies included small cell lung cancer (n=4) and epidermoid cell cancer (n=2). In one young female patient, APUSG showed a six-week fetus in the endometrial cavity.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In patients with DVT, detection of a mass with APUSG may alter the treatment plan. More importantly, APUSG may enable early detection of the pathology, and thus, early initiation of the treatment.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
