												        						<p><strong>Background:</strong> microRNAs (miRNAs) are ubiquitously dysregulated in numerous tumor cell types, including melanoma cells. The anti-tumor effect of miR-509-3p was widely evaluated in various cancers.<br /><strong>Aims:</strong> To determine the functional role of miR-509-3p in melanoma.<br /><strong>Study Design:</strong> Cell culture study.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> Expression of miR-509-3p in melanoma cell models were assessed by qRT-PCR. Cell migration and invasion were analyzed by wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. Expression levels of biomarkers of epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition were determined by Western blot. Luciferase vectors containing wildtype or mutant miR-509-3p binding site were constructed, and then dual-luciferase reporter assay.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Dysregulated miR-509-3p level was found in melanoma cells. Elevated miR-509-3p expression suppressed melanoma cell migration (P &lt; .001) and invasion (P &lt; .001) capacities. Epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition of melanoma cells was repressed by miR-509-3p, along with increased &alpha;-catenin/E-cadherin (P &lt; .001) and decreased vimentin/fibronectin (P &lt; .001). CTHRC1 (collagen triple helix repeat containing 1) contained a potential binding site for miR-509-3p, and miR-509-3p decreased protein expression of CTHRC1 in melanoma cells (P &lt; .001). CTHRC1 promoted melanoma cell migration and invasion (P &lt; .001), as well as contributed to epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition. Increased CTHRC1 expression attenuated miR-509-3p-induced inhibition of melanoma cell migration (P &lt; .001), invasion, and epithelial&ndash;mesenchymal transition.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> miR-509-3p suppressed the biological function of melanoma cells through negatively regulating CTHRC1, shedding light on miR-509-3p as a potential candidate for melanoma therapeutics and treatments.</p>												        					</div>
