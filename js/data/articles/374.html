	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are rare benign tumors that can mimic malignancy. Their precise aetiology is unknown. They are seen more frequently in childhood and the most common involvement is seen in the lungs. Primary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors of the gallbladder are rather infrequent. The present knowledge is based on case reports. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: A 66 year-old male patient presented to the hospital with complaints of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Upon physical examination, a clinical picture of abdominal tenderness on the right upper quadrant of the abdomen was identified. Laboratory examinations revealed leukocytosis and hypochromic microcytic anaemia with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels. A mass almost completely filling the gallbladder was detected by imaging studies. The patient was operated on with a malignant preoperative diagnosis and underwent a liver resection of segments 4 and 5, which included a cholecystectomy. The histopathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor including many histiocytes stained positively with CD 68.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors can be localised in the gallbladder mimicking gallbladder cancer.&nbsp;</p>
