	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: This study compared the safety and efficacy of the Supreme Laryngeal Mask Airway (S-LMA) with that of the ProSeal-LMA (P-LMA) in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Sixty adults were randomly allocated. Following anaesthesia induction, experienced LMA users inserted the airway devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Oropharyngeal leak pressure was similar in groups (S-LMA, 27.8&plusmn;2.9 cmH20; P-LMA, 27.0&plusmn;4.7 cmH20; p=0.42) and did not change during the induction of and throughout pneumoperitoneum. The first attempt success rates were 93% with both S-LMA and P-LMA. Mean airway device insertion time was significantly shorter with S-LMA than with P-LMA (12.5&plusmn;4.1 seconds versus 15.6&plusmn;6.0 seconds; p=0.02). The first attempt success rates for the drainage tube insertion were similar (P-LMA, 93%; S-LMA 100%); however, drainage tubes were inserted more quickly with S-LMA than with P-LMA (9.0&plusmn;3.2 seconds versus 14.7&plusmn;6.6 seconds; p=0.001). In the PACU, vomiting was observed in five patients (three females and two males) in the S-LMA group and in one female patient in the P-LMA group (p=0.10).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Both airway devices can be used safely in laparoscopic cholecystectomies with suitable patients and experienced users. However, further studies are required not only for comparing both airway devices in terms of postoperative nausea and vomiting but also for yielding definitive results.&nbsp;</p>
