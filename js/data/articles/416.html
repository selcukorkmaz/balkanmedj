	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Ivermectin and sulphadiazine were tested individually to determine their in vitro effects on Toxoplasma gondii grown in human epidermoid larynx carcinoma (Hep-2) cell culture.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: In-vitro study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Toxoplasma growth was quantities by an enzyme immunoassay performed directly on the fixed cultures, using a rabbit anti-T. gondii immunoglobulin G as the first antibody and a phosphatase-labeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G as the second antibody. For each drug, regression models were used to quantify the relationship between optical density values and antimicrobial agent concentrations in the cultures.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of ivermectin and sulphadiazine were found to be 0.2 &mu;g/mL and 7.3 &mu;g/mL after 48 h of exposure, respectively. None of the concentrations tested for each drugs demonstrated toxicity to Hep-2 cells after 72 h of incubation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results indicate that ivermectin significantly inhibited replication of the tachyzoites of T. gondii RH strain.</p>
