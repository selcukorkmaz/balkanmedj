However, there is no study evaluating the effects of intravenous (IV) magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) therapy on spinal anaesthesia characteristics in severely pre-eclamptic patients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of this study was to compare spinal anaesthesia characteristics in severely pre-eclamptic parturients treated with MgSO4 and healthy preterm parturients undergoing caesarean section. Thus, our primary outcome was regarded as the time to first analgesic request following spinal anaesthesia.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case-control Study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: Following approval of Institutional Clinical Research Ethics Committee and informed consent of the patients, 44 parturients undergoing caesarean section with spinal anaesthesia were enrolled in the study in two groups: Healthy preterm parturients (Group C) and severely pre-eclamptic parturients with IV MgSO4 therapy (Group Mg). Following blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, spinal anaesthesia was induced with 9 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine and 20 &micro;g fentanyl. Serum and CSF magnesium levels, onset of sensory block at T4 level, highest sensory block level, motor block characteristics, time to first analgesic request, maternal haemodynamics as well as side effects were evaluated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Blood and CSF magnesium levels were higher in Group Mg. Sensory block onset at T4 were 257.1&plusmn;77.5 and 194.5&plusmn;80.1 sec in Group C and Mg respectively (p=0.015). Time to first postoperative analgesic request was significantly prolonged in Group Mg than in Group C (246.1&plusmn;52.8 and 137.4&plusmn;30.5 min, respectively, p&lt;0.001; with a mean difference of 108.6 min and 95% CI between 81.6 and 135.7). Side effects were similar in both groups. Group C required significantly more fluids.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Treatment with IV MgSO4 in severe pre-eclamptic parturients significantly prolonged the time to first analgesic request compared to healthy preterm parturients, which might be attributed to the opioid potentiation of magnesium.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
