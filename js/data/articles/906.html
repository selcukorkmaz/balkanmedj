	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death worldwide with a continued rising mortality rate, and it represents a major socioeconomic burden. The aim of this study was to examine the costs of acute exacerbation of COPD patients admitted to two different university hospital intensive care units.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Material and Methods</strong>: We analyzed 156 patients (128 male and 28 female) who were admitted for treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD from January 1, 2005 to June 15, 2008.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: The mean age of the patients was 68.2 years. The mean length of hospitalisation stay was 10.4 days. The costs were different between survivors and non-survivors. There was a statistically significant difference between survivors and non-survivors groups in all costs except bed costs, laboratory costs, radiology costs and consultation costs.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results suggest that the cost of patients with acute exacerbations of COPD represents a considerable economic burden for the health care system in Turkey.</span></p>
