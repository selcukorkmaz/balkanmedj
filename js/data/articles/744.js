Disturbances in the antioxidant system and oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidant/antioxidant status in the serum of patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and C (CHC).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Twenty patients with CHB, 20 with CHC and 30 healthy volunteers were included in this study. Catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured in all patients and control group specthrophotometrically.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: While CAT and SOD activities were significantly lower in patients with CHC, these enzymes were significantly higher in patients with CHB compared to controls. However, MDA levels were increased in each patient group as compared to the control group. Also, antioxidant enzyme activities were found to be significantly lower and MDA levels were higher in patients with CHC, compared to patients with CHB.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We considered that insufficiency of antioxidant barrier may cause oxidative stress in patients with CHB and CHC, so antioxidant treatment should be useful for these patients.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
