Only patients using aspirin (80-325 mg) were included. The study population was divided into 2 groups regarding the use of aspirin: primary prevention (PP) group and secondary prevention (SP) group. The indication of aspirin use was evaluated following the 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the 2016 United States&nbsp; Preventative Services Task Force (USPTF) guidelines in the PP group.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> A total of 5007 patients (mean age 62.15 &plusmn; 11.05, 39% female) were enrolled. The PP group included 1132 (22.6%) patients, and the SP group included 3875 (77.4%) patients. Of the 1132 patients, inappropriate use of aspirin was determined in 100% of the patients according to the ESC guidelines, and 71% of the patients according to the USPTF guidelines. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed age OR: 0.98 CI (0.97-0.99) P = .037, smoking OR: 0.60 CI (0.44-0.82) P = .001, heart failure OR: 2.11 CI (1.14-3.92) P = .017, hypertension OR: 0.51 CI (0.36-0.74) P &lt; .001, diabetes mellitus OR: 0.34 CI (0.25-0.47) P &lt; .001, oral anticoagulant use OR: 3.01 CI (1.10-8.25) P = .032, and female sex OR: 2.73 CI (1.96-3.80) P &lt; .001 were independent predictors of inappropriate aspirin use in PP patients.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Although there are considerable differences between the USPTF and the ESC guidelines with respect to recommendations for aspirin use in PP, inappropriate use of aspirin in Turkey is frequent in real-world practice for both guidelines. Besides, heart failure, oral anticoagulant use, and the female sex of the patients were independent predictors of inappropriate use of aspirin.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
