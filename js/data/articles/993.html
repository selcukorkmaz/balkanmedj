	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Our penal codes were reviewed again in 2005. Some changes were made in routine forensic services and legal responsibilities of physicians. After the legal regulations, physicians began to worry about serious troubles they can live because of their medical malpractice. This situation is not unique only to our country. In many countries of the world, there have been similar practices in force for a long time. Especially because of the compensation due to malpractice insurance, physicians are in difficult situations. If physicians comply with principles and rules of medical ethics, the laws will protect them.</p>
