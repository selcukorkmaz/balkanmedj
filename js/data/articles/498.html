	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: We aimed to determine the safety and feasibility of general anaesthesia (GA) compared with local anaesthesia + Monitored Anaesthesia Care (LA+MAC) for One-Day Thyroid Surgery (ODTS); to assess patient and operator satisfaction with either of the anesthetic approaches.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: We reviewed prospectively 130 patients who underwent ODTS from 2008 to 2011. 64 patients were operated on under GA and 62 - under LA+MAC. All variables of patient demographic characteristics, duration and type of operation, postoperative complications, difficulty in airway management and postoperative opiate consumption were recorded and analyzed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: There is no difference in respect to length of stay, discharge time and major/minor complications rate between two groups, but in the LA+MAC group, pain appears earlier and is more severe (56min; VAS 6, 5) than in GA patients (223 min; VAS 1, 5; p&lt;0.001). Patient satisfaction was similar but the operator preference was greater for GA.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In experienced hands LA with MAC for Thyroidectomy is a safe and wise choice, but GA is even more so!</p>
