	<strong>Background</strong>: So far, many studies have shown that Human Bocavirus ( HBoV) is the main pathogen of the respiratory tract. Until now, there is no study that proves the association between HBoV and hepatitis. HBoV viremia/DNAemia has been associated closely with acute primary infection and moderate-to-severe illness but, more detailed clinical data about HBoV dissemination are still unavailable.<br />
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: Here we report a 2-years-5-months-old girl suffering from respiratory distress and heptitis followed in our intensive care unit.&nbsp; HBoV was detected in our patients nose and throat swabs concurrent with whole blood sample&nbsp; by positive polymerase chain reactions. After a through investigation no causative agent other than HBoV viremia was found.<br />
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Human Bocavirus viremia with high viral loads may be associated with hepatitis.</p>
