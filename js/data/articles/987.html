	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;">Topical therapy with glucocorticoids is used commonly in chronic dermatoses. Although side effects are less common compared to systemic use, infants who are exposed to topical corticosteroids have greater risk for Cushing syndrome or adrenocortical insuffiency caused by suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis because glucocorticoids are highly absorbed through the diaper area. However, the development of Cushing syndrome in an infant from topical steroid therapy is unusual. We present an infant with diaper dermatitis who developed iatrogenic Cushing syndrome due to prolonged clobetosel propionate use.</span></p>
