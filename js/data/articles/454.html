	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Multiple lasers and light sources are currently available for hair removal and many studies comparing efficacy and safety exist. SHR mode IPL is a technique that gives the total energy in divided doses with fewer side effects. We compared a SHR mode IPL system with alexandrite and Nd: YAG lasers for leg hair reduction</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Twenty-five female participants with skin types II&ndash;IV, underwent treatment of unwanted hair on the cruris. Three selected areas were randomly treated with the SHR mode IPL system, Alexandrite laser and Nd: YAG laser in three sessions. Hair reduction was evaluated with digital photography by a blinded assessor every 6 weeks and 6 months after the last session. Pain severity, side effects and patient satisfaction analysis were also investigated.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-one participants completed the trial. The mean hair reductions in 6 weeks after the last treatment were 50% for the IPL system, 53% for Alexandrite and 39% for the Nd: YAG lasers. However after 6 months; 40%, 49% and 34% hair reduction was observed, respectively. The Alexandrite laser was the least painful system.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although there is no obvious advantage of one laser system over the others in terms of treatment outcome, the Alexandrite laser is still the most efficient and reliable way of hair removal in fair skinned individuals.</p>
