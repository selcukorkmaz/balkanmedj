	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Penetrating neck injuries result from missiles and stab wounds. A gas pistol is a non-lethal weapon for self-defence.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: We present a case where the use of a modified gun led to multiple injuries in a single shot. Four projectiles were embedded in the neck, one in the larynx and three in the cervical spine. The first was removed via a combined external and endoscopic approach, while the rest were put on follow-up.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The reported case shows that damage from modified gas pistols, although rarely life threatening, may cause long term discomfort and diminished quality of life.</p>
