												        						<p>A 12-year-old female patient with a large ventricular septal defect (VSD), aortic valve prolapse, and aortic regurgitation was referred to our clinic. She was asymptomatic at admission, which is why her parents delayed follow-up. Her weight and height percentiles were below the normal range (-4 SDS for weight and -3.5 SDS for height). She had a loud, continuous murmur on anterior chest wall auscultation with a blood pressure of 110/44 mmHg and a heart rate of 100 bpm. The electrocardiogram (ECG) depicted no significant changes, and the chest X-ray revealed mild lung congestion and cardiomegaly. Transthoracic echocardiography showed dilated left heart chambers with a sub-arterial VSD of 10 mm complicated by a ruptured aortic noncoronary cusp connecting to the right ventricle (<a href="https://doi.org/10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2023.2023-1-75.video1">Videos 1</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2023.2023-1-75.video2">2</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2023.2023-1-75.video3">3</a>). The ventricular systolic functions were preserved. After detailing the anatomy with transesophageal echocardiography (<a href="https://doi.org/10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2023.2023-1-75.video4">Videos 4</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2023.2023-1-75.video5">5</a>), the VSD and aneurysm rupture were surgically repaired (<a href="https://doi.org/10.4274/balkanmedj.galenos.2023.2023-1-75.video6">Video 6</a>). The postoperative course was uneventful. Aortic cusp rupture is rarely encountered in the pediatric population. We suggest that this rare pathology can concomitantly exist with additional congenital cardiac defects that may be the underlying causes of hemodynamic changes due to the Venturi effect on the aortic valve. Physical examination and continuous murmur detection are crucial, as patients may present without significant symptoms or ECG changes. This pathology may go unnoticed in the presence of VSD as color flow. Doppler images may merge. Therefore, detailed echo screening is essential for achieving the diagnosis.</p>
