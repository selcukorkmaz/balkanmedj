	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation [TAVI] is widespread worldwide as an alternative therapy procedure to the patients suffering from severe aortic valve stenosis. However, we shouldn&#39;t forget that the conventional surgical aortic valve replacement is still the gold standard therapy for severe aortic valve stenosis. For the patients who cannot be treated conventionally because of high risk comorbid diseases and older age, TAVI is an effective alternative therapy method. The indications should be limited, concerning the high mortality rate, 10% within 30 days of intervention. Long term efficacy data are still inadequate. Although the indications are restricted to older patients with a STS score &gt;10 or log-Euro Score &gt;20, age is not a definite indication for this treatment. The patients should be assessed by a heart team including a non-interventional cardiologist, interventional cardiologist, cardiac anesthesiologist and cardiac surgeon according to their general status, frailty and STS- Euro score. In other words, assessment and treatment of the patient by a heart team is the main factor besides the limited power of the scoring systems. The treatment should be applied to the patients with an aortic annulus diameter between 18-27 mm and a life expectancy of at least over 1 year. The currently ongoing investigations are focused on parameters like safety, efficiency and long term reliability of TAVI. The scientific and technical developments lead to new definitions and parameters regarding the treatment indications of severe aortic valve stenosis. In this review, we present the actual data about TAVI and also our own experiences.</p>
