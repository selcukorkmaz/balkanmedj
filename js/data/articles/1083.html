	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Celiac disease (CD) was diagnosed in a 10-year-old boy who was presented with refractory iron deficiency anemia (IDA), hypertransaminasemia and short stature. Anemia resolved within one month after the institution of gluten-free diet. We performed liver biopsy because of hypergamaglobulinemia and high titers of smooth muscle antibody. On the basis of histologic findings together with clinical and laboratory findings, type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) was diagnosed. We aimed to report a CD case displaying more than one type of atypical pictures. Concomitant AIH and unusual rapid response of hepatitis to conventional treatment are also emphasized.</p>
