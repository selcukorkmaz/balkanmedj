Patients were investigated on the basis of age, sex, symptoms, findings of otoscopic examination, complications, radiological evaluations, methods of management and findings at the operation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Complications occurred predominantly in patients between 31 and 40 years of age (33.3%). Severe headache, nausea-vomiting, otalgia, purulent otorrhea and fever were the most common signs and symptoms. Meningitis was the most common (15 patients, 35.7%), brain abscess (14 patients, 33.3%) and lateral sinus thrombosis (10 patients, 23.8%) were second and third common complications. The overall mortality rate was 2.4% (in one patient who was comatose on admission), whereas it was 7.1% for patients with brain abscess.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Intracranial complications of CSOM are still a serious problem due to life-threatening condition. If a patient with active CSOM has severe headache, nausea-vomiting, otalgia and fever, otogenic intracranial complication should be considered, and detailed evaluation should be performed for early diagnosis since the level of consciousness on admission is an important prognostic factor.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
