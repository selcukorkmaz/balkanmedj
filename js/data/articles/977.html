	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Taxi drivers have the highest prevalence of work-related homicides and the underlying motive for most homicides is robbery. The objectives of this study were to reveal the features of robbery-related homicides of taxi drivers, to evaluate characteristics of murdered drivers and assailants, and to recommend preventive measures.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: We reviewed autopsy, crime investigation, security, and death records about robbery-related murders of taxi drivers in the cities İstanbul, Ankara, and İzmir in Turkey between 1996 and 2006.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: There were 109 robbery-related murders of taxi drivers (all males; mean age 41.6&plusmn;12 years). Most of the drivers were killed at night and in the evening (n=80, 90.9%; p&lt;0.01) and in the suburbs (n=53, 52.48%; p&lt;0.01). Firearms were the most frequently used weapons (n=60, 55.05%; p&lt;0.01) and most of the fatal injuries were located on the head (n=61, 41.78%; p&lt;0.01). Security measurements in taxicabs were not effective enough to prevent murders of taxi drivers.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Safety of taxi drivers can be achieved by utilization of technological safety devices, but an effective solution to this problem is the restriction of civil armament.</span></p>
