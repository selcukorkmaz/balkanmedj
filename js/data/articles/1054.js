The cases were randomly divided into three groups of 20 patients each. Group 1 received 13.5 mg hyperbaric levobupivacaine, group 2 received 12.5 mg isobaric levobupivacaine and group 3 received 15 mg isobaric levobupivacaine in a total volume of 3 ml intrathecally. Sensory and motor block, hemodynamic parameters, pain scores, adverse effects and analgesic requirements of the patients were recorded.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The time to reach T10 sensory block and the onset time to Bromage 0 were statistically different among the three groups (p&lt;0.05). The mean time to reach T10 was significantly lower in group 1 when compared with group 2 (p&lt;0.001). Regarding the mean onset time to Bromage 0, group 1 had a lower mean value than that of group 3 (p&lt;0.001). The mean duration for analgesic requirement was longer in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3 (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.05, respectively).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We concluded that the clinical efficacy of hyperbaric levobupivacaine was superior to the isobaric forms in spinal anesthesia for transurethral endoscopic surgery.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
