T1-weighted FLASH and double- echo TSE T2-weighted sequences were applied before and after contrast injection. &ldquo;Defining statistics&rdquo; were prepared according to pre and postcontrast signal intensity measurements.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: In this study there were 11 patients with metastases, 4 patients with hemangioma, 4 patients with HCC and one patient with a hemangioma and a metastasis at the same time. In cases wheret we found only hemangiomas, in all sequences, S/N ratios (p=0.043) and T2-weighted double-echo TSE with long TE SI change (p=0.043) were significant. While in the hemangiomas in T2-weighted double-echo TSE with long TE there is an decrease in the C/N ratios; in cases with metastasis and HCC, compared to other sequences significant increase in C/N ratio in T2-weighted double-echo TSE with short TE sequences was detected.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: SPIO-enhanced MR imaging can be used as a non-invasive radiologic technique for the detection focal liver lesions, to determine the number of lesions and also has a value in differentiating the benign lesions (especially hemangiomas) from primary tumors or metastatic malignant lesions.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
