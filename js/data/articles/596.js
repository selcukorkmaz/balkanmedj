The time of decannulation, nasogastric tube removal, hospitalization and oncological results were analyzed. Acoustic analysis and Voice Handicap Index (VHI) were used to evaluate vocal function.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The mean time for decannulation and nasogastric tube removal were 11.8&plusmn;7.6 and 15.4&plusmn;4.4 days, respectively. The mean duration of hospital stay was 19.3&plusmn;6.1 days. It was found that early decannulation significantly reduced patient decannulation and hospitalization time. The 5-year overall and cause-specific actuarial survival rates were 81.5% and 96.9%, respectively. The 10-year overall and cause-specific survival rates were 67% and 92.3%, respectively. The 5-year local and nodal control rates were 95.4% and 95.2%, respectively. The mean values for jitter, shimmer and noise-to-harmonic ratio were 8.10&plusmn;5.59%, 16.60&plusmn;5.81% and 0.51&plusmn;0.23, respectively, and these scores showed a significant increase. Total VHI score and subscale scores except VHI-emotional noted that patients had a mild level of vocal disability.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Tucker&#39;s operation is one of the preferred techniques in the treatment of early glottic carcinoma with its high oncologic success rate and satisfactory functional results.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
