<p>
	Urethral duplication is a rare congenital anomaly usually seen in males. We present a case of urethral duplication treated by a tubularised incised plate urethroplasty (TIPU) technique. A 5-year-old male boy was admitted to the clinic with the complaints of thin calibrated urinating and diurnal enuresis. We diagnosed distal penile hypospadias. During the operation, another urethral opening was found proximal to the previously seen hypospadiac meatus, localised on the coronary sulcus. We performed the TIPU procedure without excising the duplicated urethra. We only excised the common wall between the two urethras, and used the dorsal urethral plate of the duplicated urethra for tubularisation of the neourethra. The postoperative course was uneventful. A cystoscopy was done for suspected urogenital sinus. There was no further complaint at the third postoperative month. The TIPU technique can be successfully applied in such cases. The dorsal plate of the duplicated urethra can be used to form the neourethra.</p>
