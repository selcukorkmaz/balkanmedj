	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) is a method that determines the tissue motion and velocity within the myocardium.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: To characterize acute haemodialysis (HD)-induced changes in TDI-derived indices for patients that have end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Cross sectional study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Conventional echocardiography and TDI methods were applied to study ESRD patients (n=58) before and after HD. &nbsp;Pulmonary venous flow, mitral inflow, and TDI signals of the lateral and septal mitral annulus were examined for the determination of altered left-ventricular diastolic filling parameters. Flow velocities from early- (E) and late-atrial (A) peak transmitral; peak pulmonary vein systolic (S) and diastolic (D); and myocardial peak systolic (Sm) and peak early (Em) and late (Am) diastolic mitral annular velocities were also assessed for changes.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Transmitral E and A velocities and the E/A ratio decreased significantly after HD (p&lt;0.001). Pulmonary vein S (p&lt;0.001) and D (p&lt;0.001) velocities decreased, and S/D ratios increased significantly (p=0.027). HD led to a reduction in septal Em (p&lt;0.001), lateral Em (p=0.006), and Am (p&lt;0.001) velocities. Contrary to the decreases in Em and Am, the Em/Am ratio remained unchanged.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: A single HD session was associated with an acute deterioration in the diastolic parameters. Since the Em/Am ratio remained unchanged, we conclude that this index is a relatively load-independent measure of diastolic function in HD patients.</p>
