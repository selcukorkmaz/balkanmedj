	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Osteomas are benign, typically slow-growing tumors composed of densely sclerotic, well circumscribed bone. Laryngeal osteomas are extremely rare. We report an extremely rare case of laryngeal osteoma. The patient had complaints ofdysphonia for 3 years and, dyspnea for 1 month. There was a supraglottic mass filling the laryngeal lumen on indirect laryngoscopic examination. Mass was completely excised using microlaryngoscopic instruments. After the operation, the patient&#39;s complaints were completely resolved. Case reports and a review of the world literature concerning laryngeal osteoma and treatment are presented.</p>
