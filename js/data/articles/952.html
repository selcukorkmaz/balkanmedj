	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We investigated nosocomial infections diagnosed via consultations with the Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology at Reanimation I-II intensive care units.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Of 3750 patients hospitalized at Reanimation I-II intensive care units, 1221 patients were followed up via consultations with the Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology. Additionally, main diseases that require intensive care, other concomitant diseases, demographical data, hospital stays and isolated microorganisms were evaluated.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: Seven hundred and fifty-six patients (61.9%) were diagnosed with nosocomial infections according to the criteria of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among these infections, nosocomial pneumonia took the first place. As infectious agent, Pseudomonas spp. (19.7%) took the first place, followed by Acinetobacter spp. (17.3%) and Staphylococcus spp. (16.7%).</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Nosocomial infections are common at intensive care units. Besides infection control precautions, consultations with Infectious Diseases are also important in quick identification and treatment of these infections.</span></p>
