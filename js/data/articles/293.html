	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Adiponectin, which has anti-inflammatory features, is an important substance in several metabolic mechanisms.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of this study is to evauate the effects of exogenous intraperitoneal administration of adiponectin on the survival, intrabdominal adhesion and inflammatory cytokine levels in an experimental sepsis model.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Animal experimentation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Ninety rats were divided into a control group, adiponectin group and sham group. A cecal puncture abdominal sepsis model was performed in the adiponectin and control groups. Every three hours, exogenous adiponectin was administrated to the adiponectin group. At the 3rd and 24th hours, 10 rats were sacrified in each group in order to measure plasma tumor necrosis factor-&alpha; (TNF-&alpha;), interleukin (IL) 10, soluble intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, IL-6 and macrophage inhibitory factor levels, and the activity of nuclear factor (NF)-kB. The remaining rats were followed for survival.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The plasma levels of TNF-&alpha;, soluable ICAM-1, IL-6, and macrophage inhibitory factor were significantly higher in the control group than in the adiponectin and sham group (p&lt;0.05). The increase in inflammatory cytokines with time was more prominent in the control group. The activity of NF-kB in the control group was higher than in the adiponectin group (p&lt;0.05). The survival rate of the adiponectin group was higher than in the control group.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Administration of exogenous adiponectin to the peritoneum in abdominal sepsis increased survival and decreased intrabdominal adhesions by decreasing the inflammatory response.</p>
