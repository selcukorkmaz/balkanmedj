A community-based representative sample (N=1070) was randomly selected using cluster sampling from the catchment areas served by 19 different primary healthcare centers. A questionnaire evaluating demographic information and probable risk factors for HBV and HCV was administered, and HBsAg and anti-HCV markers were analyzed from blood samples.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: Among the 1070 individuals who participated in the study, 33.1% were male (n=354) and 66.9% female (n=716). The average age was 35.4&plusmn;13.5 (15-90) years. The seroprevalence of HBsAg positivity was 4.2% (n=45), while anti-HCV seropositivity was found to be 1.0% (n=11). Among participants who previously suffered a known hepatitis infection or who reported a family history of hepatitis, the HBsAg positivity was found to be higher (p&lt;0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between HCV transmission risk factors and anti-HCV positivity.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the first hepatitis seroprevalence study in central Sanliurfa and demonstrated moderate HBV infection endemicity.</span></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
