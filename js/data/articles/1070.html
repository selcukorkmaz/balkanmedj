	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We examined the reflection of sport awareness on body composition in the students at the School of Physical Education and Sports by determining the changes in body fat ratios over a period of four years.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: A total of 42 students (20 boys and 22 girls) from the School of Physical Education and Sports (aged between 17 to 21 years) were compared in terms of the body fat ratios using three different anthropometry-based equations. The study groups of both sexes consisted of students who exercised regularly in any type of sport at least two hours per day and three days a week within the last year. Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test was used to compare the groups.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The body fat ratios increased in all groups contrary to the expected reduction. Although there was a reduction in year 2006 values, they were still higher than year 2003 values.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: While the educational system should be reconsidered to give a shape to enhance sport and physical education awareness and willpower in the students, they should be able to force their willpowers to act as guided by their awareness as well.</p>
