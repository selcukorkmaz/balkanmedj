The upregulation of COL3A1 expression was shown to partly neutralize the effects of the miR-29 family in inhibiting methotrexate (MTX) resistance in osteosarcoma, suggesting that COL3A1 overexpression could mediate the resistance of osteosarcoma cells to MTX.<sup>8</sup> Moreover, COL3A1 expression was dramatically increased in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells to several kinds of drugs, including DDP, MTX, paclitaxel (PAC), vincristine (VIN), doxorubicin (DOX), and topotecan (TOP), indicating that COL3A1 had important involvements in the drug resistance of ovarian cancer.<sup>10</sup> Recently, Zhang et al.<sup>11</sup> compared COL3A1 expression between pan-cancer and normal tissues from public databases and observed that COL3A1 expression was highly upregulated in lung cancer, particularly lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), which was also related to advanced cancer stages and poor survival.</p>\r\n<p>Despite vast research in this field, the implication of COL3A1 in DDP-resistant lung cancer is poorly understood. Thus, this study aimed to assess COL3A1 expression and its roles in lung cancer cells with DDP resistance via bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a><a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#methods\">Methods</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#results\">Results</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#discussion\">Discussion</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"methods\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Methods</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets</strong></p>\r\n<p>The GSE21656 dataset was obtained from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). It contained raw RNA transcriptome information on three non-resistant lung cancer (H460) and three resistant lung cancer (H460/DDP) cell lines. Similarly, GPL6244 was obtained and used for mRNA expression profiling analysis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs)</strong></p>\r\n<p>H460 and H460/DDP cell lines were screened for DEGs using R v4.0.2 software (https://www.r-project.org/).<sup>12,13</sup> Background correction, standardization, and calculation of expression values were performed using the Affy, Impute, and limma packages of the R software. The limma package was used to normalize the median value of all samples, following which a robust multichip average was created, and the raw data were log-transformed. DEGs were identified based on thresholds of <em>p</em> &lt; 0.005 and |log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt; 1. Pheatmap and ggplot2 were used to create a heat map and a volcano plot in R, respectively.<sup>14</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Functional Enrichment</strong></p>\r\n<p>Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed on Metascape (https://metascape.org) to identify intersecting DEGs<sup>15</sup> using GO terms biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions, with <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05 denoting significance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GEPIA and UALCAN Database</strong></p>\r\n<p>GEPIA (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/index.html) and UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/) databases were used to analyze COL3A1 expressions in LUAD and LUSC.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Survival Analysis</strong></p>\r\n<p>The influence of COL3A1 on the overall survival (OS) of patients with LUAD and LUSC was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier Plotter web tool (https://kmplot.com/analysis/).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cell Culture</strong></p>\r\n<p>H1299, A549, and NCI-H1703 cells (lung cancer cell lines) and BEAS-2B (normal human lung cell line) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (VA, USA) and used for cell culture. PC-9 cells (BeNa Culture Collection, Beijing, China), another lung cancer cell line, were also bought. A549 was cultured in F-12K Medium. H1299 and NCI-H1703 in RPMI-1640 Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). PC-9 was cultured in a DMEM medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing high glucose levels, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. The base medium for BEAS-2B cells can be obtained from a BEBM kit (no. CC-3170, Lonza/Clonetics Corporation, Basel, Switzerland). All cells were kept at 37 &deg;C in 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>during cell culture.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Establishing DDP-Resistant Cells</strong></p>\r\n<p>Here, drug-resistant cell lines A549/DDP and H1299/DDP were obtained upon immersing A549 and H1299 cells in increasing concentration of DDP (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) from 5 to 30 &mu;M for 12 days and maintained in a complete culture medium containing 5 &mu;M of DDP for the subsequent studies.<sup>16</sup></p>\r\n<p><strong>Modification of Gene Expression</strong></p>\r\n<p>The scramble control (NC and shNC), lentiviral vector COL3A1 (catalog id: RC211766L3V), and COL3A1 shRNAs (shCOL3A1, catalog id: TL313797V) were bought from Origene (Beijing, China). GenePharma (Shanghai, China) synthesized the lentiviral vectors used to upregulate ZEB1 expression. Then, 5 &mu;g/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to infect the NC, COL3A1, shNC, and shCOL3A1 cells, after which they were immersed in 7 &mu;g/mL puromycin for 2 weeks to obtain stable transfected cell lines.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Quantitative Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR)</strong></p>\r\n<p>Total RNA was obtained using TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA), which were then converted into cDNA with the PrimeScript RT Master Mix kit (RR036A; Takara). Then, qRT-PCR was performed using a 2 x SYBR Green PCR Mastermix kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China) with the Applied Biosystems 7,500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, MA, USA). <a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/table_BMJ_2436_0.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Table 1</b></a> shows the primers used in this study.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Western Blotting</strong></p>\r\n<p>RIPA (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and 1% protease inhibitor (Solarbio) were used to obtain total proteins. Then, 20 &mu;g of the indicated proteins from each group were separated with 10% sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h at room temperature to prevent nonspecific bindings, followed by incubation with primary antibodies (anti-&beta;-actin antibody, id:ab8226; dilution, 1:5000, Abcam, MA, USA; and anti-COL3A1 antibody, id: 30565; dilution, 1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA) at 4 &deg;C for 15-18 h. Then, after incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, ProfiBlot-48 (Tecan, Switzerland) was used to evaluate protein signaling following immersion in an ECL reagent (Millipore, USA), and ImageJ was used to view the proteins on the blots.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Colony Formation</strong></p>\r\n<p>Approximately 0.5 x 10<sup>3 </sup>cells (per well) with stable COL3A1 overexpression or downregulation were incubated on 6-well plates for 12-14 days at 37 &deg;C, followed by staining with crystal violet for 10 min and counting the clone numbers using inverted microscopy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) Assay</strong></p>\r\n<p>Approximately 4 x 10<sup>3 </sup>cells (per well) with stable COL3A1 overexpression or downregulation were added onto 96-well plates and maintained for 4 h in a culture medium with 10% CCK-8 solution (Beyotime, Beijing, China) at 37 &deg;C, after which their OD450 values were detected using a spectrophotometer (Fisherbrand&trade; accuSkan&trade; GO UV/Vis, Thermo).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cell Apoptosis Assessment</strong></p>\r\n<p>After cell transfection, cell apoptosis of the cell lines was determined with the FITC AnnexinV Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, NY, USA) following the provided manual, after which FlowJo was used to determine their apoptotic rates.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong></p>\r\n<p>The study experiments were independently repeated three times. IBM SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Student t-tests and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey&rsquo;s test were employed.

Our results showed that COL3A1 was overexpressed in DDP-resistant lung cancer H460 cells, whereas COL3A1 downregulation sensitized lung cancer cells to DDP.</p>\r\n<p>The close implication of the collagen family in tumorigenesis has been well documented.<sup>19-24</sup> For example, collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation (P3H) was shown to have low expression in lung cancer, whereas its overexpression suppressed cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion, and it had pro-apoptotic roles in lung cancer.<sup>25</sup> As expected, COL3A1 has vital roles in carcinogenesis, where it serves as an oncogene.<sup>8-10</sup> Zhang et al.<sup>26</sup> reported a significant upregulation of COL3A1 expression in esophageal cancer and showed its association with advanced clinical cancer stages. In addition, COL3A1 was overexpressed in TNBC tissues and cells and was linked to a lower OS rate.<sup>27</sup> Further, COL3A1 silencing caused significant inhibitions in in vitro cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and immune escape and <em>in vivo</em> tumor growth in xenograft mice, suggesting that COL3A1 has an oncogenic role in TNBC. COL3A1 was overexpressed in breast cancer tissues compared with controls, and its expression was further upregulated by radiation,<sup>28</sup> indicating that COL3A1 might be implicated in regulating the radiation resistance of breast cancer. Zhou et al.<sup>29</sup> reported a significantly higher COL3A1 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells than in their normal counterparts and showed that it was an independent factor associated with poor OS in univariate and multivariable analyses. Besides, COL3A1 downregulation and overexpression respectively inhibited and promoted cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and cancer growth in vivo, indicating the oncogenic role of COL3A1 in ESCC. Su et al.<sup>30</sup> reported that COL3A1 overexpression could neutralize the suppressive effects of let-7d on renal cancer cell proliferation, motility, and PBMC recruitment, indicating that COL3A1 also served as an oncogene in renal cell carcinoma. Consistently, our results demonstrated COL3A1 overexpression in lung cancer cells, accelerated lung cancer cell growth and restrained apoptosis, and contributed to poor OS in lung cancer patients. Taken together, these results confirmed that COL3A1 acted as an oncogene in lung cancer.</p>\r\n<p>We also observed a significantly higher COL3A1 expression in H460/DDP cells than in its lung cancer non-resistant H460 cells, suggesting that COL3A1 regulated lung cancer sensitivity to DDP. As expected, silencing COL3A1 increased the sensitivity of A549/DDP and H1299/DDP to DDP, confirming that increased COL3A1 expression made the cancer cells more prone to DDP resistance.</p>\r\n<p>Previously, COL3A1 was reported to participate in modulating the drug resistance of cancers (10, 31). COL3A1 expression was markedly elevated in DDP, PAC, DOX, TOP, VIN, and MTX-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines.<sup>10</sup> COL3A1 upregulation partly neutralized the effects of the miR-29 family on inhibiting MTX resistance in osteosarcoma.<sup>8</sup> miR-let-7b increased the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to Taxol by downregulating COL3A1 expression.<sup>31</sup> Altogether, these studies revealed a chemoresistance-promoting role of COL3A1 in cancers, which was also confirmed in lung carcinoma. For instance, Peng et al.<sup>32</sup> showed that collagen promoted cancer resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 by promoting CD8 + T cells exhaustion. Yamazaki et al.<sup>33</sup> reported that collagen type I induced cancer cell resistance to EGFR-TKI in lung carcinoma. Further, collagen IV was reported to inhibit DDP-induced apoptosis in lung cancer.<sup>34</sup> Here, we demonstrated for the first time that COL3A1, a member of the collagen family, promoted DDP resistance in lung cancer.</p>\r\n<p>This study jas two main limitations. Although we demonstrated that COL3A1 could be an oncogene and promote drug resistance in lung cancer, the underlying mechanisms were not explored. In addition, the obtained study results were not validated in vivo.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, this study revealed a significant increase in COL3A1 expression in lung cancer cells with DDP resistance and that COL3A1 downregulation decreased cell resistance to DDP. Taken together, targeting COL3A1 could potentially overcome DDP resistance in lung cancer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ethics Committee Approval:</strong> As this study is a cell culture and public database analysis, it does not require ethical approval.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Data Sharing Statement:</strong> The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Author Contributions:</strong> Design- L.W., Y.S.; Data Collection or Processing- L.W., Y.S., Z.G.; Analysis or Interpretation- Z.G.; Writing- H.L.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> No conflict of interest was declared by the authors.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Funding:</strong> This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province (Grant No.2021JJ30525), Outstanding Youth Program of Hunan Education Department (Grant No. 19B419) and Human Clinical Medical Technology Innovation Guidance Project (Grant No. 2020SK51405).</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#methods\">Methods</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#results\">Results</a><a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#discussion\">Discussion</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"reference\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Reference</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>REFERENCES</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Bray F, Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Siegel RL, Torre LA, Jemal A.
