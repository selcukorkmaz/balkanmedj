HGI has been proposed as a biomarker reflecting individual susceptibility to the deleterious effects of glycation, including advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction.<sup>9</sup> These processes are also implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and neuronal injury.<sup>10</sup></p>\n<p>Despite the biological plausibility of a link between HGI and neurological outcomes in sepsis, this association has not been systematically investigated. Understanding whether HGI predicts delirium risk in sepsis patients could provide insights into the role of glycation-mediated injury in SAE and potentially identify a modifiable risk factor or a novel prognostic marker. Accordingly, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine the association between HGI and delirium risk in sepsis patients admitted to the ICU, employing multiple analytical approaches including logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and restricted cubic spline analyses.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"methods\">\n<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>\n<p>This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, version 2.0) database, which contains de-identified health records of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2008 and 2019.<sup>11</sup> Access to the database was granted after completion of the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) program. The study was exempt from institutional review board approval given the de-identified nature of the data.</p>\n<p>Adult patients (age &ge; 18 years) admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of sepsis, defined according to the Sepsis-3 criteria (suspected infection with a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score increase of 2 or more points), were eligible for inclusion.<sup>12</sup> Patients were required to have available HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose measurements within 24 hours of ICU admission. Exclusion criteria included: ICU length of stay less than 24 hours, pre-existing dementia or neurodegenerative disease, traumatic brain injury, primary central nervous system infection, hepatic encephalopathy (total bilirubin > 10 mg/dL), history of substance abuse withdrawal, missing Glasgow Coma Scale data, and administration of neuromuscular blocking agents precluding delirium assessment during the first 48 hours. After applying these criteria, 3,744 patients were included in the final analysis.</p>\n<p>HGI was calculated as the difference between measured HbA1c and predicted HbA1c. Predicted HbA1c was derived from a linear regression equation of HbA1c on fasting plasma glucose in the study population: predicted HbA1c (%) = 0.0164 x fasting glucose (mg/dL) + 3.834. Thus, HGI = measured HbA1c - predicted HbA1c. Patients were categorized into tertiles based on HGI distribution: low (T1, HGI < -0.47), middle (T2, HGI -0.47 to 0.31), and high (T3, HGI > 0.31).</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was the development of delirium during the ICU stay, assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), which was performed by trained ICU nurses at least twice daily as part of routine clinical care.<sup>13</sup> Delirium was defined as at least one positive CAM-ICU assessment during the ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included delirium duration (days with positive CAM-ICU), time to first delirium episode, ICU mortality, and 28-day mortality.</p>\n<p>Covariates collected included demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index), comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, prior stroke, and Charlson Comorbidity Index), admission characteristics (SOFA score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II [APACHE II] score, mechanical ventilation status, vasopressor use, surgical admission), laboratory values (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, lactate, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, white blood cell count, platelet count), and medication exposures (sedatives, opioids, corticosteroids, insulin).</p>\n<p>Continuous variables were reported as means with standard deviations or medians with interquartile ranges. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages. Baseline characteristics were compared across HGI tertiles using one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.</p>\n<p>The association between HGI and delirium was evaluated using three complementary approaches. First, multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for delirium across HGI tertiles, with the middle tertile (T2) as the reference group. Models were sequentially adjusted: Model 1 for age, sex, and race; Model 2 additionally for SOFA score, APACHE II score, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor use; and Model 3 further for diabetes status, Charlson Comorbidity Index, sedative and opioid exposure, and laboratory parameters. Second, Cox proportional hazards models were fitted with time to first delirium episode as the outcome, using the same adjustment strategy. Third, restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression with four knots was used to explore the dose-response relationship between continuous HGI and delirium risk, testing for nonlinearity. Subgroup analyses were performed stratifying by diabetes status, SOFA score tertile, and age group. Sensitivity analyses included propensity score-matched analyses and exclusion of patients with HbA1c > 9.0% (indicating poorly controlled diabetes). All statistical tests were two-sided with a significance level of 0.05. Analyses were performed using R version 4.2.3 with the rms, survival, and MatchIt packages.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"results\">\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>Among the 3,744 included patients, the mean age was 66.8 (SD 14.2) years, 56.3% were male, and 38.2% had diabetes mellitus. The median SOFA score was 7 (IQR 5-10) and the mean APACHE II score was 22.4 (SD 7.8). Delirium occurred in 1,524 patients (40.7%) during the ICU stay. The mean HbA1c was 6.2% (SD 1.4%), mean fasting glucose was 142.6 (SD 58.3) mg/dL, and mean HGI was -0.01 (SD 0.84).</p>\n<p>Patients in the lowest HGI tertile (T1) were more likely to have lower HbA1c values despite similar glucose levels, younger age, and lower prevalence of diabetes compared to those in the highest tertile (T3). Conversely, T3 patients had higher rates of diabetes (54.1% vs 28.3% in T1, p < 0.001), higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, and higher APACHE II scores. Delirium incidence was 45.8% in T1, 34.6% in T2, and 41.8% in T3.</p>\n<p>In the fully adjusted logistic regression model (Model 3), the lowest HGI tertile was associated with a significantly higher odds of delirium compared to the middle tertile (OR = 1.677; 95% CI: 1.382-2.035; p < 0.001), representing a 67.7% increased risk. The highest HGI tertile also showed elevated odds (OR = 1.324; 95% CI: 1.089-1.610; p = 0.005). These findings were consistent across progressive adjustment levels, with minimal attenuation of effect estimates, suggesting robustness to confounding.</p>\n<p>Cox proportional hazards models yielded concordant results. In the fully adjusted model, the low HGI group had a significantly higher hazard of delirium (HR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.31-1.81; p < 0.001), while the high HGI group demonstrated a moderately elevated hazard (HR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.08-1.51; p = 0.004), both relative to the middle tertile. The median time to first delirium episode was 2.1 days (IQR 1.2-4.3) in T1, 3.4 days (IQR 1.8-6.1) in T2, and 2.7 days (IQR 1.4-5.2) in T3.</p>\n<p>The restricted cubic spline analysis revealed a statistically significant nonlinear (U-shaped) relationship between continuous HGI and delirium risk (p for nonlinearity = 0.003). The nadir of risk was observed at an HGI value of approximately -0.34, corresponding to a mildly negative HGI. Below this inflection point, delirium risk increased sharply with decreasing HGI; above this point, risk increased gradually with increasing HGI. The U-shaped pattern persisted after stratification by diabetes status, although the ascending limb (high HGI) was steeper in patients with diabetes (p for interaction = 0.021).</p>\n<p>Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the U-shaped association was present across all predefined subgroups, although the magnitude varied. The association was stronger in patients with higher illness severity (SOFA &ge; 8: OR for T1 vs T2 = 1.89 vs SOFA < 8: OR = 1.42; p for interaction = 0.038) and in older patients (&ge;70 years: OR for T1 vs T2 = 1.82 vs <70 years: OR = 1.51; p for interaction = 0.11). Among secondary outcomes, low HGI was associated with longer delirium duration (median 3.2 vs 2.1 days, p < 0.001) and higher ICU mortality (19.4% vs 14.2%, p = 0.002). Sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching (1,124 matched pairs) confirmed the primary findings, with the low HGI group maintaining significantly elevated delirium risk (OR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.28-1.95).</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"discussion\">\n<h3>Discussion</h3>\n<p>In this retrospective cohort study of 3,744 sepsis patients in the ICU, we identified a significant U-shaped association between the hemoglobin glycation index and delirium risk, with the lowest risk observed at an HGI of approximately -0.34. Patients in the lowest HGI tertile had a 67.7% higher odds of delirium compared to those in the middle tertile, while the highest HGI tertile also carried a 32.4% excess risk. These findings were consistent across multiple analytical approaches and robust to sensitivity analyses.</p>\n<p>The U-shaped relationship between HGI and delirium risk is a novel finding that warrants mechanistic consideration. The elevated delirium risk observed at both extremes of the HGI distribution may reflect distinct but converging pathophysiological pathways. At the high HGI end, enhanced hemoglobin glycation suggests increased formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which activate the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) signaling cascade.<sup>14</sup> RAGE activation promotes neuroinflammation through nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway stimulation, increases blood-brain barrier permeability, and induces oxidative stress in cerebral endothelial cells and neurons.<sup>15</sup> These processes are directly implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis-associated delirium.</p>\n<p>The stronger association observed at the low HGI end is more intriguing and may reflect a different set of mechanisms. A low HGI indicates lower-than-expected HbA1c for a given glucose level, which could result from increased erythrocyte turnover, hemolysis, or altered erythrocyte membrane properties.<sup>16</sup> In the context of sepsis, these conditions are common and may serve as markers of disease severity and microvascular dysfunction. Furthermore, a low HGI may indicate a metabolic milieu characterized by greater glucose variability, as individuals with rapid glucose fluctuations may have lower average glycation despite experiencing repeated hyperglycemic spikes.<sup>17</sup> Glycemic variability has been independently associated with oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and adverse neurological outcomes in critically ill patients.<sup>18</sup></p>\n<p>The inflection point at HGI = -0.34 is clinically meaningful, as it suggests that a mildly negative HGI, rather than a zero value, corresponds to the optimal glycation profile with respect to delirium risk. This finding aligns with observations that slightly lower HbA1c levels (within the non-diabetic range) are associated with the best outcomes in critical care settings, potentially reflecting a balance between the deleterious effects of both excessive and insufficient glycation.<sup>19</sup></p>\n<p>Our finding that the association was modulated by illness severity (stronger in patients with higher SOFA scores) is biologically plausible. More severe sepsis is characterized by greater systemic inflammation, microvascular dysfunction, and metabolic derangement, all of which may amplify the adverse effects of abnormal glycation on the brain.<sup>20</sup> The interaction with diabetes status, wherein the ascending limb of the U-shaped curve was steeper in diabetic patients, suggests that chronic hyperglycemia may sensitize the brain to glycation-mediated injury during acute illness.</p>\n<p>Several studies have examined the relationship between HGI and outcomes in various clinical settings. Hempe et al. demonstrated that high HGI was associated with increased microvascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes.<sup>8</sup> More recently, high HGI has been linked to adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndromes.<sup>21</sup> However, the U-shaped relationship we observed has not been previously reported and may be specific to the ICU setting, where the clinical significance of both high and low HGI extremes is magnified by the acute physiological stress of sepsis.</p>\n<p>The clinical implications of our findings are twofold. First, HGI may serve as a readily calculable prognostic marker for delirium risk in sepsis patients, potentially enhancing existing prediction models. Second, the U-shaped relationship suggests that glycemic management strategies in the ICU should aim not only to avoid hyperglycemia but also to minimize glycemic variability and maintain a stable glycation profile. Whether targeted interventions to normalize HGI can reduce delirium incidence requires investigation in prospective trials.</p>\n<p>This study has several strengths, including a large sample size, use of a well-validated delirium assessment tool (CAM-ICU), comprehensive adjustment for confounders, and multiple complementary analytical approaches. The use of restricted cubic splines allowed detection of the nonlinear relationship, which would have been missed by conventional linear analyses.</p>\n<p>However, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the retrospective, single-center design limits causal inference and generalizability. Second, HbA1c and fasting glucose were measured at a single time point, and we could not assess changes in HGI over the ICU stay. Third, CAM-ICU, while having high specificity, may underestimate delirium incidence, particularly the hypoactive subtype.<sup>22</sup> Fourth, despite comprehensive adjustment, residual confounding from unmeasured variables (e.g., detailed medication timing, nutritional status, sleep disruption) cannot be excluded. Fifth, the calculation of HGI from a population-specific regression equation means that our HGI values may not be directly comparable to those derived in other populations. Sixth, we could not assess glucose variability directly, as continuous glucose monitoring data were not available for most patients.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates a U-shaped association between the hemoglobin glycation index and delirium risk in sepsis patients in the ICU, with an inflection point at HGI = -0.34. Both low and high HGI values were associated with significantly increased delirium risk, suggesting that extremes of hemoglobin glycation, whether enhanced or diminished, may contribute to sepsis-associated encephalopathy through distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Prospective validation and mechanistic studies are warranted to confirm these findings and explore their therapeutic implications.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol class=\"references-list\">\n<li>Rudd KE, Johnson SC, Agesa KM, et al.
