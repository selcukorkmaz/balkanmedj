The aim of this study is to examine the effect of quercetin, which is a strong antioxidant bioflavonoid, on oxidant damage and antioxidant capacity in various organs in the case of medium-term or long-term diabetic rat.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Forty-eight male Wistar rats were divided into five groups, namely, control group, diabetic group of 8-weeks, diabetic group of 16-weeks, quercetin treated diabetic group of 8-weeks, and quercetin treated diabetic group of 16-weeks. At the end of the experiment, malondialdehyde levels, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured in the lung, aorta, heart, spleen, liver, and kidney tissues.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: MDA levels were elevated in all tissues except in the lung in non-treated diabetic groups. Quercetin treatment increased the antioxidant enzyme capacities and considerably reduced oxidant damage.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We suggest that quercetin has a protective effect on the aorta, heart, brain, liver, and kidneys from oxidant damage in the case of mediumterm or long-term diabetic rat. It can be argued that quercetin is effective by increasing the antioxidant defence capacity in this process.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
