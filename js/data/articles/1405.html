<p>
	Verrucous carcinoma is a very rare entity in the urinary bladder, and it is usually associated with Condyloma accuminatum and schistosomiasis. Though chronic irritation is accepted as a common etiological factor in few rare cases, bladder stone has not been demonstrated among irritative etiologic agents. Verrucous carcinoma in the bladder of a man of 54 years, who underwent three surgical interventions in the last 20 years because of bladder stone, is presented. The histopathological diagnosis of the specimen from the third operation was verrucous carcinoma of the bladder. Recently the fourth operation; a transurethral resection was performed, as the verrucous carcinoma relapsed.</p>
