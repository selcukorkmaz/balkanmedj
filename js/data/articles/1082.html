	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Although tetanus is a vaccine-preventable disease, it still occurs due to deficiency in vaccination. We followed eight patients (median age 44 years; %75 men) with tetanus referred to our center between 1998-2002. They had contracted tetanus by surgical wound, burn, animal bite or minor wounds. Five of them had sought medical care when injured. Their wounds were treated (four patients), but tetanus vaccination was applied to only one patient, none were given tetanus immune globulin (TIG). Tetanus was fatal in half of the patients and death occurred within 2-30 days. Even minor injuries carry a risk for this highly fatal illness, and the patients&#39; primary vaccination history is very important for treatment. Knowledge and awareness of healthcare workers, especially emergency department workers should be refreshed periodically. Wound treatment, TIG and tetanus toxoid applications are as important as primary immunization.</p>
