	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The prevalence and incidence of multiple sclerosis may vary according to the influence of the altitude of a geographical area as well as the genetic and environmental factors. This study ained to determine the incidence and prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Edirne population.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: Patients with a definite diagnosis of MS according to McDonald&#39;s criteria, admitted to one of the three MS clinics in Edirne, were included in this two-stage study. Also the records of hospitals in İstanbul serving patients from Edirne, have been evaluated.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The prevalence rate of confirmed MS patients was 33.9/100000 (95% CI: 32-36) in 2003. The mean annual incidence was 3.48/100000 (95% CI: 2.90-4.00). Mean age of the patients was 36.5&plusmn;9.6 years. Mean age at onset was 29.2&plusmn;8.5 years. Mean duration of disease was 6.9&plusmn;5.2 years. Overall, 69.2% had a relapsing-remitting course, 20.5% had a primary progressive course and 10.3% had a secondary progressive course. Mean Expanded Disability Status Scale score was 3.04&plusmn;2.18. The prevalence and annual incidence after one year was 36.5 per 100000 (95% CI: 33.2-38.6) and 2.60 per 100000 (95% CI: 2.1-3.8), respectively.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is the first city-based MS prevalence study performed in Turkey. The MS prevalence in Edirne is similar to that of Greece and Bulgaria but lower than that of European countries.</p>
