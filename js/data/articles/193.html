	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and obesity are serious health problems in the World, including Turkey. Contemporary studies have suggested a meaningful association between insulin resistance (IR), MetS parameters, and thyroid function tests.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: We aimed to elucidate the impact of fat distribution on the anthropometric and laboratory parameters, especially indices of MetS, IR and thyroid function, in obese women.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Cross-sectional study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Anthropometric measurements of all participants and biochemical tests in their serum samples were performed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Weight, waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), and other parameters of fat distribution were significantly increased in all obese compared to control subjects; but there was no significant difference between central and peripheral obese groups. The central obese group had significantly higher insulin levels, components of MetS, the ratio free triiodothyronine (fT3) to free thyroxin fT4, and fT4 than those of peripheral obese and control groups.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Elevated triglyceride, glucose and insulin levels may be associated with increased IR, which in turn is related to MetS. Body fat composition may affect thyroid tests in the obese; the changes in fT3/fT4 could be the consequence of fat distribution.</p>
