Some recent studies have shown that inflammation has an important role in the pathophysiology of pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of this study is to evaluate serum pentraxin 3 and high sensitive (hs)-C reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in children with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) secondary to untreated congenital heart defects and evaluate the role of inflammation in pulmonary hypertension.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Cross sectional study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: After ethics committee approval and receiving consent from parents, there were 31 children were selected for the study with severe PAH, mostly with a left-to-right shunt, who had been assessed by cardiac catheterisation and were taking specific pulmonary vasodilators. The control group consisted of 39 age and gender matched healthy children. After recording data about all the patients including age, gender, weight, haemodynamic studies and vasodilator testing, a physical examination was done for all subjects. Blood was taken from patients and the control group using peripheral veins to analyse serum Pentraxin 3, N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-ProBNP) and hs-CRP levels. Serum Pentraxin-3 levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and expressed as ng/mL. Serum hs-CRP levels were measured with an immunonephelometric method and expressed as mg/dL. The serum concentration of NT-proBNP was determined by a chemiluminescent immunumetric assay and expressed as pg/mL.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Serum Pentraxin- 3 levels were determined to be 1.28&plusmn;2.12 (0.12-11.43) in the PAH group (group 1) and 0.40&plusmn;0.72 (0.07-3.45) in group 2. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p&lt;0.01). Serum hs-CRP levels were measured as 2.92&plusmn;2.12 (0.32-14.7) mg/dL in group 1 and 0.35&plusmn;0.16 (0.07-3.45) mg/dL in group 2. The hs-CRP level was increased in the PAH group to a significant degree (p&lt;0.01).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study showed that pentraxin 3 and hs-CRP levels were increased significantly in the PAH group. We consider that inflammation plays an important role in severe pulmonary hypertension and progressive pulmonary arterial hypertension in children with PAH.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
