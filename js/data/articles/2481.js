This is a crucial hypothesis that has not been tested. CVDs are still the leading cause of death, even in early stages of life.<sup>8</sup> Increasing evidence supports the relationship between OD and cardiovascular events (e.g., OD in heart failure patients) and thromboembolic events (e.g., <em>UGT2A1</em> polymorphisms as the responsible partner in different studies). Considering this perspective, it may be important that primary and secondary preventive measures against CVDs are implemented for patients with OD to reduce the long-term effects of endothelial damage in the post-COVID-19 syndrome. Additionally, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, conducting studies examining the relationships between OD and CVDs may help in the development of new diagnostic and treatment methods against CVDs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Informed consent was obtained from the patient.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Author</strong><strong>ship</strong><strong> Contributions:</strong> Concept- E.A., A.K.; &nbsp;Design- E.A., A.K.; &nbsp;Analysis or Interpretation- E.A., A.K.; &nbsp;Data Collection and/or Processing- E.A., A.K.; &nbsp;Literature Review- E.A., A.K.; &nbsp;Writing- E.A., A.K.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> No conflict of interest was declared by the authors.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
