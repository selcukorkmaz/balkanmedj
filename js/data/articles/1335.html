	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	In the advanced stages of Parkinson&#39;s disease, non-motor complications presenting as behavioral disorders can accompany motor complications. In this report, we presented a 73-year-old male patient who had Parkinson&#39;s disease of three-year duration and developed excessive eating and sexual desire after the addition of a dopamine agonist to levodopa treatment. Impulse control disorders manifesting as compulsive eating and hypersexuality were attributed to dopamine replacement therapy. After the cessation of the dopamine agonist these behavioral disorders disappeared.</p>
