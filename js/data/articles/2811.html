<h3>Editorial</h3>
<p>It is with great pleasure that we announce a significant milestone in the history of the Balkan Medical Journal. Beginning with Volume 43, Issue 1 (January 2026), our journal will transition from a bimonthly to a monthly publication schedule. This decision reflects the sustained growth in the quality and quantity of submissions we have received over the past several years, as well as our commitment to reducing publication timelines and providing timely dissemination of important medical research to our readership.</p>
<p>The Balkan Medical Journal has experienced remarkable growth since its inception. Over the past five years, the number of annual submissions has increased by more than 60%, with manuscripts arriving from over 40 countries across six continents. This international interest has been accompanied by a steady improvement in the quality of submitted work, enabling us to maintain a rigorous peer-review process while selecting research of the highest scientific merit. Our acceptance rate has stabilized at approximately 18%, ensuring that published articles meet stringent standards of methodological rigor and clinical relevance. The journal's impact factor has shown consistent upward trends, reflecting the growing recognition of the Balkan Medical Journal as a respected venue for biomedical research.</p>
<p>The transition to monthly publication brings several important advantages. First and foremost, it will substantially reduce the time from manuscript acceptance to publication. Under the bimonthly schedule, accepted manuscripts occasionally experienced delays of several months before appearing in print, a situation that was particularly disadvantageous for time-sensitive research. With monthly issues, we anticipate reducing the average acceptance-to-publication interval to approximately four to six weeks. Second, the increased number of issues will allow us to publish a greater volume of high-quality research each year, accommodating the growing number of meritorious manuscripts that our peer-review process identifies. Third, monthly publication aligns the Balkan Medical Journal with the practices of leading international biomedical journals, enhancing our visibility and competitiveness in the global scientific publishing landscape.</p>
<p>To support this transition, we have expanded our editorial board with the addition of twelve distinguished researchers from diverse medical specialties and geographic regions. These new board members bring expertise in areas including molecular biology, clinical trials methodology, biostatistics, and digital health, complementing the existing strengths of our editorial team. We have also invested in streamlining our manuscript management system, implementing enhanced plagiarism detection tools, and establishing dedicated teams for each stage of the editorial workflow. These improvements are designed to maintain the quality of our peer-review process while accommodating the increased publication frequency.</p>
<p>We are also pleased to announce several accompanying initiatives. The journal will introduce structured abstracts for all original research articles, facilitating systematic identification and retrieval of key findings. We will expand our commitment to open science principles by encouraging data sharing statements, preregistration of clinical trials, and transparent reporting of statistical methods. Additionally, we are developing a social media strategy to enhance the visibility and real-world impact of published research through platforms including Twitter, LinkedIn, and ResearchGate.</p>
<p>We extend our sincere gratitude to our authors, reviewers, editorial board members, and readers whose dedication and support have made this milestone possible. The Balkan Medical Journal remains committed to publishing high-quality, peer-reviewed research that advances medical knowledge and improves patient care across the Balkans and beyond. We look forward to this exciting new chapter and invite the global research community to continue contributing their best work to our journal.</p>
