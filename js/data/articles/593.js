The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of exercise on ADMA and SDMA levels and related ratios in type 2 DM.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Thirty-six women with type 2 DM and 44 healthy women were recruited to the study. Fourteen and 19 subjects, respectively, attended four-weeks of moderate intensity exercise. Plasma SDMA, ADMA, and L-arginine levels were measured by the HPLC method initially, after the first exercise session, and after one month.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: All measurements were within the normal range in both groups and did not change significantly immediately after exercise and after the first month. In the healthy group, L-arginine/ADMA and L-arginine/SDMA ratios after one month were significantly higher than the initial values (p&lt;0.022 and p=0.017, respectively). After one month of exercise, L-arginine/ADMA and L-arginine/SDMA ratios increased in diabetics and decreased in healthy subjects when compared to those after the first exercise session (p=0.026 and p=0.037, respectively).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We suggest that L-arginine/ADMA and L-arginine/SDMA ratios should be used in spite of absolute values. These molecules have a substantial role in the beneficial effects of exercise in healthy subjects while their role is small in diabetics.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
