  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Thyroid nodules are among the most commonly encountered endocrine pathologies in clinical practice, with a prevalence of 19-68% in the general population when detected by high-resolution ultrasonography.<sup>1</sup> While the vast majority of these nodules are benign, approximately 5-15% harbor malignancy, necessitating a systematic approach to their evaluation and management.<sup>2,3</sup> Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) remains the gold standard for the preoperative assessment of thyroid nodules, and the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology provides a standardized framework for categorizing cytological findings.<sup>4</sup></p>
  <p>Among the six Bethesda categories, Category III (atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance, AUS/FLUS) represents a particularly challenging diagnostic gray zone. The implied malignancy risk for Bethesda III lesions ranges from 6% to 30%, with considerable institutional variability.<sup>5,6</sup> Current guidelines recommend repeat FNAB, molecular testing, or diagnostic lobectomy for these indeterminate nodules, each approach carrying its own limitations including additional cost, procedural risk, and diagnostic uncertainty.<sup>7</sup></p>
  <p>The tumor microenvironment and the host immune response play critical roles in thyroid carcinogenesis. Chronic inflammation has been increasingly recognized as a contributor to malignant transformation, with inflammatory mediators modulating cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune evasion.<sup>8</sup> Interleukin-17A (IL-17A), a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced predominantly by T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several malignancies, including colorectal, breast, and hepatocellular carcinoma.<sup>9,10</sup> In the context of thyroid disease, IL-17A has been associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and papillary thyroid carcinoma, suggesting a potential link between Th17-mediated inflammation and thyroid malignancy.<sup>11</sup></p>
  <p>Calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer), a calcium-binding protein primarily expressed by neutrophils and monocytes, serves as a biomarker of inflammation and has been extensively studied in gastrointestinal diseases.<sup>12</sup> Elevated serum calprotectin levels have been reported in various malignancies, and emerging evidence suggests its involvement in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis through the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathways.<sup>13</sup> However, the utility of serum calprotectin as a diagnostic biomarker for thyroid malignancy has not been adequately explored.</p>
  <p>This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of preoperative serum IL-17A and calprotectin levels in differentiating benign from malignant thyroid nodules in patients with Bethesda III cytology, thereby potentially providing a non-invasive adjunctive tool to guide clinical decision-making in this diagnostically challenging population.</p>

  <h3>Materials and Methods</h3>
  <p><strong>Study Design and Population.</strong> This prospective observational study was conducted at the Departments of General Surgery and Endocrinology at a tertiary care academic medical center between January 2022 and June 2024. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (approval number: 2021/14-28) and conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p>
  <p>A total of 76 consecutive patients with thyroid nodules classified as Bethesda III on initial FNAB who subsequently underwent thyroid surgery (total thyroidectomy or lobectomy) were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were: (1) age 18-75 years; (2) FNAB result of Bethesda III (AUS/FLUS); (3) planned surgical intervention based on clinical assessment; and (4) available preoperative serum samples. Exclusion criteria included: (1) concurrent autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease) confirmed by anti-TPO antibody levels >100 IU/mL; (2) active systemic infection or inflammatory disease; (3) history of any malignancy within the past 5 years; (4) immunosuppressive therapy; (5) pregnancy; and (6) prior thyroid surgery or radioiodine therapy.</p>
  <p><strong>Ultrasonographic Assessment.</strong> All patients underwent standardized thyroid ultrasonography using a high-frequency linear transducer (7.5-12 MHz). Nodule characteristics including size, echogenicity, margins, calcification pattern, and vascularity were recorded. Risk stratification was performed according to the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS).<sup>14</sup></p>
  <p><strong>Blood Sample Collection and Biomarker Analysis.</strong> Fasting venous blood samples were collected within 48 hours prior to surgery. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes, and serum aliquots were stored at -80 &deg;C until analysis. Serum IL-17A levels were measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; catalog no. D1700) with a detection range of 15.0-1000 pg/mL and intra-assay coefficient of variation <6%. Serum calprotectin levels were determined using a quantitative ELISA kit (Hycult Biotech, Uden, Netherlands; catalog no. HK325-02) with a detection range of 0.4-25 ng/mL and intra-assay coefficient of variation <7%. All measurements were performed in duplicate according to the manufacturers' instructions.</p>
  <p><strong>Histopathological Examination.</strong> Final histopathological diagnosis served as the reference standard. All surgical specimens were examined by two independent pathologists blinded to biomarker results. Malignant diagnoses were classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Thyroid Tumors, 5th edition.<sup>15</sup> Patients were divided into two groups based on final pathology: benign (Group 1) and malignant (Group 2).</p>
  <p><strong>Statistical Analysis.</strong> Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and MedCalc version 20.0. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality of continuous variables. Normally distributed variables were expressed as mean &plusmn; standard deviation and compared using the independent samples t-test, while non-normally distributed variables were expressed as median (interquartile range) and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the discriminative ability of IL-17A and calprotectin for predicting malignancy. The optimal cut-off values were determined using the Youden index. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of malignancy. A two-tailed p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <p>Of the 76 patients included, 54 (71.1%) were female and 22 (28.9%) were male, with a mean age of 48.7 &plusmn; 12.3 years. Based on final histopathological examination, 52 patients (68.4%) had benign pathology (Group 1) and 24 patients (31.6%) had malignant pathology (Group 2). Among the malignant cases, papillary thyroid carcinoma was the most common histotype (n = 18, 75.0%), followed by follicular thyroid carcinoma (n = 4, 16.7%) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (n = 2, 8.3%).</p>
  <p>The two groups were comparable in terms of age (p = 0.412), sex distribution (p = 0.328), body mass index (p = 0.567), and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (p = 0.218). Nodule size was larger in the malignant group (mean 22.4 &plusmn; 8.7 mm vs. 18.9 &plusmn; 9.2 mm), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.112). ACR TI-RADS category was significantly higher in the malignant group (p = 0.024).</p>
  <p>Serum IL-17A levels were significantly elevated in the malignant group compared to the benign group (median 78.4 pg/mL [IQR: 52.1-118.6] vs. 41.2 pg/mL [IQR: 28.7-67.3]; p < 0.001). Similarly, serum calprotectin levels were significantly higher in patients with malignant pathology (median 3.82 ng/mL [IQR: 2.41-5.67] vs. 2.64 ng/mL [IQR: 1.73-4.12]; p = 0.038).</p>
  <p>ROC curve analysis demonstrated that serum IL-17A had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.733 (95% CI: 0.618-0.848; p < 0.001) for predicting malignancy. The optimal cut-off value for IL-17A was 56.8 pg/mL (Youden index), yielding a sensitivity of 79.2%, specificity of 63.5%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 50.0%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 86.8%. Serum calprotectin had an AUC of 0.639 (95% CI: 0.509-0.769; p = 0.038), with an optimal cut-off of 3.14 ng/mL providing a sensitivity of 62.5%, specificity of 61.5%, PPV of 42.9%, and NPV of 78.0%.</p>
  <p>The combination of IL-17A and calprotectin (using a logistic regression-derived predictive score) yielded an improved AUC of 0.791 (95% CI: 0.688-0.894; p < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 71.2%, PPV of 57.1%, and NPV of 90.2%. In multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, nodule size, and ACR TI-RADS category, elevated serum IL-17A (OR: 3.87; 95% CI: 1.62-9.24; p = 0.002) and ACR TI-RADS category (OR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.18-5.47; p = 0.017) were identified as independent predictors of malignancy, while calprotectin showed a trend toward significance (OR: 1.94; 95% CI: 0.92-4.09; p = 0.081).</p>
  <p>Subgroup analysis by histological type revealed that IL-17A levels were highest in papillary thyroid carcinoma (median 82.6 pg/mL), followed by follicular carcinoma (median 68.3 pg/mL), compared to follicular adenoma (median 44.8 pg/mL) and nodular hyperplasia (median 38.2 pg/mL). Calprotectin levels followed a similar pattern but with less pronounced differences between malignant subtypes.</p>

  <h3>Discussion</h3>
  <p>This study demonstrates that preoperative serum IL-17A and calprotectin levels are significantly elevated in patients with malignant Bethesda III thyroid nodules and may serve as adjunctive biomarkers to improve the diagnostic accuracy of the preoperative workup in this clinically challenging population. The combination of these two inflammatory biomarkers yielded a notable predictive performance with an AUC of 0.791, suggesting potential clinical utility.</p>
  <p>The Bethesda III category remains a diagnostic conundrum, as the heterogeneous malignancy risk (6-30%) makes it difficult to uniformly recommend either surveillance or surgery.<sup>5,16</sup> Molecular testing platforms such as Afirma Gene Expression Classifier and ThyroSeq have improved the management of indeterminate nodules; however, their widespread adoption is limited by cost, availability, and the requirement for adequate cytological material.<sup>17,18</sup> Our findings suggest that serum biomarkers could provide a complementary and more accessible approach to risk stratification.</p>
  <p>The association between elevated serum IL-17A and thyroid malignancy observed in our study is consistent with the growing body of evidence linking Th17-mediated inflammation to cancer development. Xue et al. reported increased IL-17A expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma tissues compared to normal thyroid tissue, and demonstrated that IL-17A promoted tumor cell proliferation through activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway.<sup>19</sup> Similarly, Gu et al. found elevated circulating Th17 cells and serum IL-17A levels in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, with levels correlating with tumor stage and lymph node metastasis.<sup>20</sup> Our study extends these observations to the preoperative setting and demonstrates the discriminative value of serum IL-17A specifically within the Bethesda III population.</p>
  <p>The elevated calprotectin levels in malignant cases suggest that neutrophil-mediated inflammation contributes to the tumor microenvironment in thyroid cancer. Calprotectin promotes tumor progression through multiple mechanisms, including the activation of RAGE signaling, stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine release, and promotion of angiogenesis.<sup>21</sup> While serum calprotectin alone showed moderate discriminative ability (AUC: 0.639), its inclusion in the combined model improved overall predictive performance, supporting its role as a complementary rather than standalone biomarker.</p>
  <p>The NPV of 90.2% achieved by the combined biomarker model is particularly relevant clinically, as it could help identify patients with a high probability of benign disease who may safely undergo active surveillance rather than surgery, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgical morbidity. However, the PPV of 57.1% indicates that nearly half of the patients flagged as potentially malignant by the model would have benign pathology, underscoring the need for further refinement and validation in larger cohorts.</p>
  <p>Our study has several limitations. First, the relatively small sample size (n = 76) limits the generalizability of our findings and the precision of our estimates. Second, the single-center design may introduce selection bias. Third, we excluded patients with concurrent autoimmune thyroid disease, which frequently coexists with Bethesda III nodules and could confound biomarker levels. Fourth, the cross-sectional design precludes assessment of temporal changes in biomarker levels. Fifth, molecular testing was not performed on our cohort, preventing direct comparison with established molecular classifiers. Future multicenter studies with larger sample sizes, inclusion of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease, and head-to-head comparison with molecular testing platforms are warranted.</p>
