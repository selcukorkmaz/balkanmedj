Out of 336 students 200 (59.5%) (90 males, 110 females, mean age 24.11&plusmn;1.87 years; range 21 to 34 years) were included in the study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: There were 129 (64.5%) never smokers, 18 (9%) ex-smokers and 53 (26.5%) current smokers. Smoking rate was increasing with age. Nicotine addiction test scores corresponded to the least addiction. The most frequently declared reason to quit smoking were worries related to health. The most frequently declared reasons to restart smoking were stress and smoking friends. Counseling to quit smoking, nicotine replacement and drug use were very limited.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Counseling to quit smoking was insufficient even in this advantageous group of medical students. Action planning targeting physician candidates is immediately required to enhance national movement against smoking.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
