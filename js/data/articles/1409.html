<p>
	Amniotic band sequence (ABS) is a sporadic congenital anomaly characterized by amputation of limbs, constriction bands, pseudosyndactylism, multiple craniofacial, visceral and abdominal wall defects. A female preterm infant of 30 weeks, weighing 1310 g and born to a mother who did not receive regular antenatal follow- up, was born with multiple congenital anomalies requiring resuscitation at birth was referred to our clinic. Her physical examination revealed antimongoloid slant, bilateral large and low-set ears, presence of circular constriction bands on second and fourth distal interphalangeal joints and absence of 3rd digit by the amputation of the proximal interphalengeal joint on the right hand, pes calcaneus deformity, constriction band on toe and syndactly of other digits of right foot, equinovarus deformity and amputation of all digits other than 5th digit of left foot. No other external and internal organ involvement was noted. Plastic surgery consultation was made. She was discharged on postnatal day 7 upon the request of her parents.</p>
