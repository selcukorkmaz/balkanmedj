	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	A twenty-two-month-old infant who had a diagnosis of Apert syndrome during the neonatal period underwent surgery for inguinal hernia. The possibility of difficult intubation was considered and necessary measures were taken. Ventilation via a facemask was difficult due to face abnormalities. The patient was intubated successfully after induction with 3% isoflurane and intravenous 0.25 mg mivacurium. A detailed physical examination with regard to difficult intubation followed by implementation of necessary preparations may enable a successful intubation in patients with Apert syndrome.</p>
