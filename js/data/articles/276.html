	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Iatrogenic acute dissection of the ascending aorta following coronary angiography and percutaneous intervention is rare. This complication, if not managed urgently, can have critical results.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: We present the case of a 70 year-old woman who was treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the right coronary artery (RCA) for acute inferior myocardial infarction; however, the procedure was complicated by anterograde dissection of the RCA with a simultaneous retrograde propagation to the proximal part of the ascending aorta. Successful stenting of the entry point was able to heal the RCA and restrict the retrograde propagation to the ascending aorta. The aortic dissection was monitored by means of computerised tomography and the dissection repaired itself spontaneously within a day.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Treatment of the aorta coronary dissection (ACD) by urgent osteal stenting is a less invasive treatment compared with surgical treatment in appropriate cases. We demonstrated that immediate osteal stenting should be performed in ACD.&nbsp;</p>
