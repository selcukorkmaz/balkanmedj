History, clinical features, patient characteristics, and localizations of rupture, diagnostic modalities, and treatment outcomes were reported.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Two of the patients were intubated with a single-lumen tube, whereas 3 patients were intubated by using a double-lumen tube. The most common symptom that led to diagnosis was subcutaneous emphysema. One patient was diagnosed during stump control before the occurrence of symptoms. It is considered that using a stylet during intubation might be a risk factor, as four of our patients were intubated with the help of a stylet. Only one patient had a difficult intubation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Close postoperative monitorization of patients intubated due to surgical interventions, may enable us to determine tracheal ruptute cases in the early period before symptoms occur. The most common symptom was subcutaneous emphysema in the present case series. Thus, it is considered as the most effective warning symptom. In the light of the above findings, it is suggested that difficult intubation may not add to the risk of tracheal rupture.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
