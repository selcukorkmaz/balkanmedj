<p>
	White adipose tissue (WAT) is a dynamic multicellular assembly composed of adipocytes and stromovascular cells, including fibroblasts, endothelial and immune cells, nerve fibers, and stem cells. In humans, WAT is a responsive and secretory (endocrine and paracrine) tissue partitioned into two large depots (subcutaneous and visceral) and many small depots associated with the heart, blood vessels, major lymph nodes, prostate gland, ovaries and mammary glands. This short review conceptualizes evidence for the paracrine activity of adipose tissue in founding a new research field, designated adipoparacrinology. Here we focus on (i) epicardial and periadventitial adipose tissue in atherogenesis, (ii) mammary gland-associated adipose tissue in breast cancer, and (iii) periprostatic adipose tissue in prostate cancer. Other examples include: (i) mesenteric adipose tissue in Crohn&#39;s disease, (ii) lymph node-associated (perinodal) adipose tissue in Crohn&#39;s disease and HIV-associated adipose redistribution syndrome, (iii) infrapatellar fat pad (Hoffa&#39;s fat pad) in knee osteoarthritis, (iv) orbital adipose tissue in thyroid-associated (Graves&#39;) ophthalmopathy, and (v) parasellar region-associated adipose tissue in brain disorders. The therapy aspect of adipoparacrinology is also discussed.</p>
