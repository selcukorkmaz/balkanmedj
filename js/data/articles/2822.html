  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by the larval stage of <em>Echinococcus granulosus</em>, remains a significant zoonotic parasitic disease with worldwide distribution. Endemic regions include the Mediterranean basin, Central Asia, parts of South America, East Africa, and the Middle East, where close contact between humans, domestic animals, and definitive hosts sustains the parasite's life cycle.<sup>1,2</sup> The disease predominantly affects the liver (60-70%) and lungs (20-30%), with involvement of other organs considered uncommon.<sup>3</sup></p>
  <p>Urogenital system involvement by CE is relatively rare, accounting for approximately 2-4% of all cases, yet it presents unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.<sup>4,5</sup> The kidney is the most frequently affected urogenital organ, followed by the adrenal glands and reproductive organs. Due to the slow-growing nature of hydatid cysts and the anatomical complexity of the urogenital tract, these lesions are frequently misdiagnosed as neoplastic, congenital, or other cystic pathologies.<sup>6</sup></p>
  <p>The clinical presentation of urogenital CE varies considerably depending on the organ involved, cyst size, and the presence of complications such as rupture, secondary infection, or compression of adjacent structures. In the kidney, patients may present with flank pain, palpable mass, or hydatiduria, the latter being considered pathognomonic but observed in only a minority of cases.<sup>7</sup> In the female genital system, cysts may mimic ovarian tumors or endometriotic cysts, while in the male genital system, testicular or prostatic involvement can be confused with malignancy.<sup>8,9</sup></p>
  <p>Diagnostic modalities including ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play a crucial role in identifying these lesions; however, the preoperative diagnostic accuracy remains suboptimal for unusual locations. Serological tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect hemagglutination (IHA) provide supportive evidence but may yield false-negative results in extrahepatic disease.<sup>10,11</sup></p>
  <p>Despite numerous case reports and small series in the literature, a comprehensive synthesis of the epidemiological, clinical, and therapeutic characteristics of urogenital CE has been lacking. This systematic review aims to consolidate the available evidence on urogenital CE, characterize the demographic and clinical profile of affected patients, evaluate diagnostic accuracy, and assess treatment outcomes.</p>

  <h3>Methods</h3>

  <h4 id="search-strategy">Search Strategy</h4>
  <p>This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines.<sup>12</sup> A comprehensive literature search was performed across PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases from inception through December 2025. The search strategy employed the following terms combined with Boolean operators: ("cystic echinococcosis" OR "hydatid cyst" OR "hydatid disease" OR "Echinococcus granulosus") AND ("urogenital" OR "kidney" OR "renal" OR "adrenal" OR "bladder" OR "ureter" OR "urethra" OR "prostate" OR "testis" OR "epididymis" OR "seminal vesicle" OR "ovary" OR "uterus" OR "fallopian tube" OR "vagina" OR "vulva"). Reference lists of included studies and relevant review articles were manually screened to identify additional eligible publications.</p>

  <h4 id="study-selection">Study Selection</h4>
  <p>Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts for eligibility. Studies were included if they: (1) reported confirmed cases of CE involving any component of the urogenital system; (2) provided sufficient clinical, diagnostic, or therapeutic data; and (3) were published in English, French, Turkish, or Spanish. Exclusion criteria comprised: (1) alveolar echinococcosis cases; (2) studies lacking individual patient data; (3) conference abstracts without full text; and (4) duplicate publications. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus with a third reviewer. After removal of 1,247 duplicates from an initial 3,182 records, 1,935 unique records were screened. Following title and abstract screening, 623 articles underwent full-text review, of which 490 studies meeting all inclusion criteria were retained for final analysis.</p>

  <h4 id="data-extraction">Data Extraction</h4>
  <p>A standardized data extraction form was developed and piloted on 20 randomly selected studies before full implementation. The following variables were extracted: study characteristics (author, year, country, study design), patient demographics (age, sex, geographic origin), clinical presentation (symptoms, duration, associated findings), diagnostic workup (imaging modalities, serological tests, preoperative diagnosis), cyst characteristics (location, size, type per WHO-IWGE classification), treatment approach (surgical technique, medical therapy, combination), and outcomes (follow-up duration, recurrence, complications). For studies reporting aggregate data, individual patient information was extracted when available or summary statistics were recorded.</p>

  <h4 id="quality-assessment">Quality Assessment</h4>
  <p>Quality assessment was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklists appropriate for each study design. Case reports and case series were evaluated using the JBI checklist for case reports (8-item) and case series (10-item), respectively. Observational studies were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Each study was classified as high quality (score >70%), moderate quality (50-70%), or low quality (<50%). The majority of included studies (n = 312, 63.7%) were case reports, followed by case series (n = 128, 26.1%), retrospective cohort studies (n = 38, 7.8%), and prospective studies (n = 12, 2.4%).</p>
</section>

<section id="results">
  <h3>Results</h3>
  <p>A total of 490 studies encompassing 698 confirmed cases of urogenital CE were included in the final analysis. The mean age of patients was 42.3 years (range: 3-87 years), with a female-to-male ratio of 1.3:1. Cases were reported from 54 countries, with the highest number originating from Turkey (n = 142, 20.3%), followed by Tunisia (n = 87, 12.5%), Iran (n = 76, 10.9%), Morocco (n = 54, 7.7%), and Greece (n = 41, 5.9%).</p>

  <h4 id="urinary-system">Urinary System Involvement</h4>
  <p>The urinary system was the most commonly affected site, accounting for 561 cases (80.4%). The kidney was involved in 478 cases (68.5% of all cases), making it the predominant site of urogenital CE. Among renal cases, the left kidney was affected in 52.3% and the right kidney in 41.7%, with bilateral involvement in 6.0%. The mean cyst diameter was 9.7 cm (range: 2.1-28 cm). Flank pain was the most common presenting symptom (71.8%), followed by palpable abdominal mass (34.2%), hematuria (18.6%), and hydatiduria (12.4%). Concomitant hepatic involvement was present in 14.8% of renal cases.</p>
  <p>The adrenal gland was the second most frequently affected urinary organ, with 64 cases (9.2%). Adrenal CE predominantly affected the right side (57.8%) and was frequently misdiagnosed as adrenal adenoma, pheochromocytoma, or adrenocortical carcinoma. The mean cyst size at presentation was 8.3 cm. Only 4 of 64 patients (6.3%) had a correct preoperative diagnosis. Bladder involvement was documented in 12 cases (1.7%), with presenting symptoms including dysuria, frequency, and hematuria. Ureteral and urethral involvement were exceedingly rare, with only 5 and 2 reported cases, respectively.</p>

  <h4 id="female-genital">Female Genital System</h4>
  <p>The female genital system was involved in 110 cases (15.8%). The ovary was the most commonly affected site (n = 51, 7.3%), followed by the uterus (n = 24, 3.4%), fallopian tube (n = 8, 1.1%), broad ligament (n = 7, 1.0%), and other pelvic locations (n = 20, 2.9%). Ovarian CE was most frequently misdiagnosed as ovarian cystadenoma or dermoid cyst. Presenting symptoms included abdominal pain (76.4%), pelvic mass (54.5%), menstrual irregularities (18.2%), and infertility (9.1%). Mean age at presentation for female genital CE was 36.7 years. In 14 cases, the diagnosis was made incidentally during cesarean section or other gynecological surgery.</p>

  <h4 id="male-genital">Male Genital System</h4>
  <p>Male genital system involvement was the least common, comprising 27 cases (3.9%). The prostate was affected in 9 cases, followed by the seminal vesicle (n = 6), testis (n = 5), epididymis (n = 4), and spermatic cord (n = 3). Prostatic CE presented with lower urinary tract symptoms mimicking benign prostatic hyperplasia, while testicular involvement was commonly misdiagnosed as testicular tumor, prompting radical orchiectomy in 3 of 5 cases before the correct diagnosis was established.</p>

  <h4 id="diagnostics">Diagnostic Methods</h4>
  <p>Ultrasonography was the initial imaging modality in 82.4% of cases and provided the correct diagnosis in 38.7%. CT was performed in 64.3% of cases with a diagnostic accuracy of 61.2%, while MRI was used in 28.9% with the highest accuracy of 72.8%. Serological testing was reported in 312 cases: ELISA was positive in 67.3%, IHA in 58.9%, and specific IgE in 71.4%. Notably, 134 of 155 surgically treated patients for whom preoperative diagnosis data were available (86.5%) were initially misdiagnosed as having neoplastic or other non-parasitic pathology.</p>

  <h4 id="treatment">Treatment Outcomes</h4>
  <p>Surgical treatment was the primary therapeutic approach in 621 cases (89.0%). Cyst excision or partial cystectomy was the most common procedure (42.3%), followed by organ-sparing surgery with cyst enucleation (28.7%), total organ removal (nephrectomy, adrenalectomy, oophorectomy) in 21.4%, and percutaneous drainage (PAIR technique) in 7.6%. Preoperative or postoperative albendazole therapy was administered in 54.3% of cases. Recurrence was reported in 28 cases (4.5%) over a mean follow-up of 32 months. Anaphylaxis occurred in 3 cases (0.5%) during surgical manipulation. Mortality was reported in 2 cases, both related to anaphylactic shock during intraoperative cyst rupture.</p>

  <h3>Discussion</h3>
  <p>This systematic review represents the most comprehensive analysis of urogenital CE to date, encompassing 698 confirmed cases from 490 published studies spanning over seven decades. Our findings confirm that urogenital involvement, although considered rare in the context of overall CE disease burden, represents a clinically significant entity with notable diagnostic and therapeutic implications.</p>
  <p>The predominance of renal involvement (68.5%) is consistent with hematogenous dissemination of the parasite through the systemic circulation after passage through the hepatic and pulmonary filters.<sup>13</sup> The rich vascular supply of the kidney and its role as a filtration organ may explain its susceptibility. The left-sided predominance observed in our review (52.3%) aligns with previous reports and may relate to the anatomical position and venous drainage patterns.<sup>14</sup></p>
  <p>Perhaps the most clinically significant finding of this review is the remarkably high rate of preoperative misdiagnosis (86.5%). This finding underscores the importance of including CE in the differential diagnosis of cystic lesions in the urogenital tract, particularly in patients from endemic regions. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities was suboptimal for urogenital locations compared to hepatic CE, where ultrasonography achieves diagnostic rates exceeding 90%.<sup>15</sup> The atypical imaging characteristics of urogenital hydatid cysts, including absence of typical daughter cysts or laminated membrane in some cases, contribute to diagnostic difficulty.</p>
  <p>The serological sensitivity observed in this review (67.3% for ELISA) is lower than the reported sensitivity for hepatic CE (85-95%), which is consistent with the known phenomenon of reduced antibody response in extrahepatic disease locations.<sup>16,17</sup> This finding suggests that negative serology should not exclude the diagnosis of urogenital CE when imaging findings are suggestive.</p>
  <p>The treatment paradigm for urogenital CE continues to favor surgical intervention, with organ-sparing approaches being preferred when feasible. The shift toward conservative surgery is reflected in the relatively low rate of total organ removal (21.4%), particularly for renal CE where nephron-sparing surgery has become the standard of care.<sup>18</sup> The PAIR technique, although well-established for hepatic CE, was employed in only 7.6% of urogenital cases, likely reflecting the anatomical challenges and limited evidence for this approach in extrahepatic locations.<sup>19</sup></p>
  <p>The recurrence rate of 4.5% in our review is comparable to that reported for hepatic CE (2-25%) and supports the use of adjuvant albendazole therapy, which was associated with lower recurrence rates in our analysis.<sup>20</sup> The two mortality cases highlight the potentially life-threatening nature of intraoperative anaphylaxis and emphasize the need for preparedness and precautionary measures during surgery for suspected or confirmed hydatid cysts.</p>
  <p>Several limitations of this review merit consideration. First, the predominance of case reports and case series inherently limits the quality of evidence and introduces publication bias. Second, the heterogeneity in reporting standards across studies precluded meta-analytical synthesis for most outcomes. Third, the long time span of included publications encompasses significant changes in diagnostic and surgical techniques, making temporal comparisons challenging. Finally, the restriction to studies published in four languages may have excluded relevant publications from endemic regions.</p>

  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>Urogenital CE is a rare but clinically significant manifestation of echinococcal disease that poses substantial diagnostic challenges. The kidney is the most commonly affected organ, followed by the adrenal gland and ovary. The high rate of preoperative misdiagnosis (86.5%) emphasizes the critical need for heightened clinical awareness, particularly in endemic regions. A combination of imaging, serology, and epidemiological risk assessment should guide the diagnostic approach. Surgical management with organ-sparing techniques remains the cornerstone of treatment, supplemented by adjuvant albendazole therapy. Future studies employing standardized reporting frameworks and prospective data collection are needed to further refine diagnostic algorithms and therapeutic strategies for urogenital CE.</p>
