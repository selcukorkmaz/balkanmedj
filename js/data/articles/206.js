The median arcuate ligament (MAL) is a fibrous arch that unites the diaphragmatic crura on either side of the aortic hiatus and, while it normally passes cranial to the origin of the celiac truncus, a low-lying ligament may lead to compression of the celiac artery and is the one of the major causes of CAS.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Case Report</strong>: In this paper, we present a patient with a mass in the gastric bulbus who was diagnosed with celiac artery stenosis during the pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). MAL was the cause of the celiac artery stenosis, determined based on the findings of preoperative computed tomography (CT).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although CAS is usually asymptomatic due to the collateral blood supply, it may be associated with potentially disastrous results due to ischemia of the upper abdominal organs as a result of disruption of the collateral pathways. It is especially important to recognize the presence of CAS and its etiology before interventional procedures. With the increasing use of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), it becomes essential for radiologists to be aware of this entity and the cross-sectional findings.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
