	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Tumors of fibrous tissue origin (fibromatosis) in chest and mediastinum have been rarely reported in the literature. Herein, we report a rare case of aggressive fibromatosis presenting as an intrathoracic tumor. A 36-year-old woman admitted to our hospital due to a feeling of oppression and pain in the left chest. A chest X-ray, thorax computed tomography revealed a large mass filling two thirds of lower left thorax. Widely surgical resection of the tumor was performed thoracotomy via seventh intercostal space. The tumor was 20x15x15 mm in size and diagnosed pathologically as aggressive fibromatosis. The patient has been well without recurrence for 15 months after surgery.</p>
