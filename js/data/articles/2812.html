<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is the most prevalent monogenic autoinflammatory disease worldwide, predominantly affecting populations of Mediterranean descent, including Turks, Arabs, Armenians, and Sephardic Jews. First described in 1945 by Siegal as "benign paroxysmal peritonitis" and subsequently defined as a distinct clinical entity by Heller in 1958, FMF is characterized by recurrent, self-limited episodes of fever accompanied by serositis, most commonly manifesting as peritonitis, pleuritis, or synovitis. The disease follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, though autosomal dominant transmission and pseudo-dominant inheritance have been increasingly recognized, particularly in populations with high carrier frequencies.</p>
<p>The molecular basis of FMF was elucidated in 1997 with the positional cloning of the MEFV gene on chromosome 16p13.3 by two independent consortia. The MEFV gene encodes pyrin (also known as marenostrin), a 781-amino acid protein predominantly expressed in neutrophils, monocytes, and dendritic cells. Pyrin functions as an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that detects bacterial modifications of Rho GTPases, serving as a guard mechanism against pathogen virulence strategies. Gain-of-function pathogenic variants in MEFV lead to dysregulated activation of the pyrin inflammasome, resulting in excessive interleukin-1 beta (IL-1B) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) production and the characteristic inflammatory episodes.</p>
<p>Despite being considered a monogenic disease with relatively straightforward Mendelian inheritance, FMF exhibits remarkable phenotypic variability that cannot be fully explained by MEFV genotype alone. Patients carrying identical mutations may present with vastly different disease severity, age of onset, frequency of attacks, and susceptibility to secondary amyloidosis. This phenotypic heterogeneity has prompted investigation into additional genetic, epigenetic, and environmental modifiers of disease expression. Emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA regulation, may play a significant role in modulating the inflammatory response in FMF and influencing both phenotypic variability and treatment response.</p>
<p>This comprehensive review aims to provide an updated synthesis of the current understanding of FMF pathogenesis, with particular emphasis on the pyrin inflammasome, the expanding landscape of MEFV genetics, and the emerging role of epigenetic regulation. We examine how these molecular insights are reshaping our understanding of disease mechanisms and informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies. By integrating recent advances in inflammasome biology, genetics, and epigenomics, we seek to provide a framework for understanding the complex genotype-phenotype relationships in FMF and to highlight promising directions for future research.</p>

<section id="pathogenesis">
<h3>Pathogenesis and the Pyrin Inflammasome</h3>
<p>The pyrin inflammasome has emerged as a central mediator of the innate immune response and the primary effector pathway in FMF pathogenesis. The pyrin protein is composed of several functional domains: an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD), a bZIP transcription factor domain, a B-box zinc finger domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal B30.2/SPRY domain where the majority of FMF-associated pathogenic variants cluster. Under physiological conditions, pyrin exists in an autoinhibited state maintained by phosphorylation of two serine residues (Ser208 and Ser242) by the kinases PKN1 and PKN2, which are effectors of the RhoA GTPase. This phosphorylation enables binding of 14-3-3 regulatory proteins, which maintain pyrin in its inactive conformation.</p>
<p>Activation of the pyrin inflammasome occurs when bacterial toxins or effector proteins inactivate RhoA GTPases, leading to decreased PKN1/2 kinase activity and subsequent dephosphorylation of pyrin. The released pyrin undergoes conformational changes that expose its PYD domain, which recruits the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) through homotypic PYD-PYD interactions. ASC then oligomerizes to form the characteristic ASC speck, which in turn recruits and activates caspase-1 through CARD-CARD interactions. Activated caspase-1 processes the pro-forms of IL-1B and IL-18 into their mature, bioactive forms and cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD), generating N-terminal fragments that form pores in the plasma membrane, leading to the inflammatory form of cell death known as pyroptosis and the extracellular release of mature cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns.</p>
<p>In FMF, gain-of-function pathogenic variants in the B30.2/SPRY domain of pyrin lower the activation threshold of the inflammasome, rendering it more susceptible to activation by physiological stimuli. The most common FMF-associated variant, M694V, has been shown to reduce the binding affinity of 14-3-3 proteins to pyrin, thereby destabilizing the autoinhibited state and facilitating spontaneous inflammasome assembly. This gain-of-function mechanism explains the dominant-negative effect observed with heterozygous M694V carriers who may manifest clinical disease. The concept of a lowered activation threshold, rather than constitutive activation, is consistent with the episodic nature of FMF attacks and the observation that disease activity is influenced by environmental factors including stress, infections, and physical exertion.</p>
<p>Recent research has revealed additional layers of complexity in pyrin inflammasome regulation. Microtubule dynamics play a crucial role in pyrin inflammasome assembly, with colchicine, the mainstay of FMF treatment, exerting its therapeutic effect by disrupting microtubule-dependent transport of pyrin to ASC specks. The mevalonate kinase pathway, which provides geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate for RhoA prenylation, has been identified as another regulator of pyrin activation, establishing a mechanistic link between mevalonate pathway disorders and pyrin inflammasome dysregulation. Furthermore, post-translational modifications of pyrin beyond phosphorylation, including ubiquitination and SUMOylation, have been implicated in the fine-tuning of inflammasome responses. These findings have expanded the therapeutic target space for FMF and related autoinflammatory conditions.</p>

<h3>Genetics of FMF</h3>
<p>The genetic landscape of FMF is dominated by pathogenic variants in the MEFV gene, with over 380 sequence variants reported in the Infevers database to date. The vast majority of clinically significant variants are clustered in exon 10, which encodes the B30.2/SPRY domain, and include the five most common pathogenic variants: M694V, M680I, M694I, V726A, and E148Q. The M694V variant is the most prevalent and is associated with the most severe phenotype, including earlier age of onset, higher frequency of attacks, and increased risk of secondary AA amyloidosis. The M680I variant carries intermediate severity, while V726A is generally associated with milder disease. The pathogenicity of E148Q, located in exon 2, remains debated, as it is found at high carrier frequencies in several populations and demonstrates incomplete penetrance.</p>
<p>The inheritance pattern of FMF is classically described as autosomal recessive, and the majority of patients carry biallelic pathogenic variants. However, a significant proportion of clinically diagnosed FMF patients, ranging from 20% to 40% in various series, carry only a single identifiable MEFV variant or no detectable variants at all. Several explanations have been proposed for this genotype-phenotype discordance, including the presence of deep intronic or regulatory variants not detected by conventional sequencing, the contribution of modifier genes, epigenetic alterations, and the possibility of oligogenic inheritance. Additionally, the phenomenon of pseudo-dominance, where a heterozygous individual manifests disease due to the high carrier frequency of MEFV variants in the population, has been well documented in endemic regions.</p>
<p>Modifier genes have been increasingly recognized as contributors to FMF phenotypic variability. Variants in SAA1, encoding serum amyloid A1, have been identified as the strongest genetic modifier of amyloidosis susceptibility, with the SAA1 alpha/alpha genotype conferring a significantly increased risk of renal amyloidosis independent of MEFV genotype. Variants in MICA (MHC class I chain-related gene A), IL1B, IL6, and NLRP3 have also been reported to modify disease severity and phenotype. More recently, genome-wide association studies have identified additional susceptibility loci, though the effect sizes of individual common variants are small. The emerging picture is one of a complex genetic architecture in which the primary MEFV genotype is modulated by a constellation of modifier genes, each contributing incrementally to the overall phenotype.</p>
<p>The application of next-generation sequencing technologies has also revealed novel aspects of MEFV genetics. Somatic mosaicism for MEFV variants has been identified as a cause of late-onset FMF in individuals who test negative on standard genetic panels. Copy number variations affecting the MEFV locus, though rare, have been reported in a small number of patients. Furthermore, the identification of MEFV variants in the heterozygous state in patients with non-FMF autoinflammatory phenotypes has suggested that pyrin dysregulation may contribute to a broader spectrum of inflammatory diseases beyond classical FMF. These genetic complexities underscore the importance of comprehensive genetic evaluation and the limitations of targeted mutation panels that interrogate only the most common variants.</p>

<section id="epigenetics">
<h3>Epigenetic Regulation</h3>
<p>Epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as a promising frontier in the study of FMF pathogenesis and phenotypic variability. DNA methylation, the most extensively studied epigenetic modification, involves the addition of methyl groups to cytosine residues at CpG dinucleotides, generally resulting in transcriptional silencing. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from FMF patients has revealed widespread methylation changes compared with healthy controls, affecting genes involved in innate immunity, inflammatory signaling, and cell death pathways. Notably, hypomethylation of the IL1B promoter has been reported in FMF patients during both attack and attack-free periods, suggesting a constitutive epigenetic priming of the IL-1B axis that may lower the threshold for inflammatory activation.</p>
<p>Differential methylation of the MEFV gene itself has been investigated as a potential mechanism for phenotypic variability. Studies have identified hypomethylation of CpG sites in the MEFV promoter region in patients with severe phenotypes compared with those with mild disease, independent of genotype. This epigenetic upregulation of MEFV expression could amplify the gain-of-function effect of pathogenic variants by increasing the cellular pool of mutant pyrin protein. Conversely, hypermethylation of MEFV has been observed in asymptomatic carriers, potentially explaining why not all individuals carrying biallelic pathogenic variants develop clinical disease. These findings suggest that DNA methylation status at the MEFV locus may serve as a biomarker for disease activity and phenotype prediction.</p>
<p>Histone modifications represent another important layer of epigenetic regulation in FMF. Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3), an activating mark associated with gene transcription, has been found to be enriched at the promoters of pro-inflammatory genes, including IL1B, NLRP3, and PYCARD (encoding ASC), in monocytes from FMF patients. Conversely, the repressive histone mark H3K27me3 is depleted at these loci. This histone modification pattern is consistent with an epigenetically poised inflammatory state that facilitates rapid and exaggerated cytokine production upon stimulation. Colchicine treatment has been shown to partially normalize these histone modification patterns, suggesting that the therapeutic effects of colchicine may extend beyond its well-established role in microtubule disruption to include epigenetic modulation of inflammatory gene expression.</p>
<p>Non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), have attracted growing attention as epigenetic regulators in FMF. Several miRNAs have been identified as differentially expressed in FMF patients, including miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-20a, all of which have established roles in inflammatory signaling. miR-155, which promotes NF-kB activation and IL-1B production, is upregulated in FMF patients during attacks and correlates with disease severity. miR-146a, a negative regulator of the NF-kB pathway, shows variable expression patterns that may contribute to the heterogeneity of inflammatory responses among patients. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also emerging as potential regulators, though their roles in FMF remain largely unexplored. The epigenetic landscape of FMF thus represents a complex, multilayered regulatory network that interfaces with genetic variation to determine the final disease phenotype.</p>

<h3>Clinical Manifestations and Management</h3>
<p>The clinical hallmark of FMF is recurrent, self-limited episodes of fever and serositis, typically lasting 24-72 hours. Peritonitis is the most common manifestation, occurring in approximately 90% of patients and presenting as acute abdominal pain that may mimic surgical emergencies. Pleuritis occurs in 20-40% of patients, presenting as unilateral chest pain with shallow breathing. Monoarticular arthritis, predominantly affecting large joints of the lower extremities, is reported in 50-75% of patients and can be particularly debilitating when it assumes a chronic, destructive pattern. Less common manifestations include pericarditis, scrotal inflammation (tunica vaginalis involvement), and erysipelas-like erythema, a characteristic migratory skin lesion typically affecting the lower extremities.</p>
<p>The most serious long-term complication of FMF is secondary (AA) amyloidosis, which results from chronic elevation of serum amyloid A (SAA) protein and leads to progressive organ damage, predominantly affecting the kidneys. Before the introduction of colchicine prophylaxis, renal amyloidosis was the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in FMF, with progression to end-stage renal disease in a substantial proportion of patients. The risk of amyloidosis is influenced by genotype (highest with homozygous M694V), geographic origin, male sex, family history of amyloidosis, and the SAA1 gene polymorphism. Importantly, subclinical inflammation persisting between attacks contributes to amyloid deposition even in patients who appear clinically quiescent, underscoring the importance of maintaining inflammatory suppression during apparently asymptomatic intervals.</p>
<p>Colchicine remains the cornerstone of FMF management and is recommended for all patients with a confirmed diagnosis, regardless of attack frequency or severity. At a dose of 1-2 mg daily (adjusted for age and weight in children), colchicine prevents attacks in approximately 60-65% of patients and reduces attack frequency by at least 50% in an additional 20-30%. Crucially, colchicine provides protection against the development of amyloidosis, even in patients who continue to experience breakthrough attacks. The mechanism of action involves disruption of microtubule polymerization, which inhibits neutrophil migration, adhesion, and degranulation, and, as more recently demonstrated, prevents pyrin inflammasome assembly by blocking microtubule-dependent transport processes.</p>
<p>Approximately 5-10% of FMF patients are resistant to colchicine at maximum tolerated doses, and an additional 2-5% are intolerant due to gastrointestinal side effects. For these patients, biologic agents targeting IL-1 have revolutionized treatment. Anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist), canakinumab (anti-IL-1B monoclonal antibody), and rilonacept (IL-1 trap) have all demonstrated efficacy in colchicine-resistant FMF, with canakinumab being the only biologic currently approved by the European Medicines Agency for this indication. Anti-IL-1 therapy effectively suppresses both clinical attacks and subclinical inflammation, as evidenced by normalization of acute phase reactants and SAA levels. Emerging therapeutic approaches under investigation include JAK inhibitors, anti-IL-18 agents, and selective pyrin inflammasome inhibitors, though these remain in early stages of development. The integration of genetic, epigenetic, and clinical data into personalized treatment algorithms represents a promising direction for optimizing the management of this complex autoinflammatory disease.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Familial Mediterranean Fever, despite being one of the earliest recognized and most extensively studied monogenic autoinflammatory diseases, continues to reveal new layers of biological complexity. The elucidation of the pyrin inflammasome as a guard mechanism for Rho GTPase modification has provided a compelling molecular framework for understanding FMF pathogenesis, while simultaneously connecting it to fundamental principles of innate immune surveillance. The expanding genetic landscape, including the recognition of modifier genes, somatic mosaicism, and oligogenic contributions, has challenged the traditional view of FMF as a simple Mendelian disorder and offered explanations for the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity observed in clinical practice.</p>
<p>The emerging role of epigenetic regulation in FMF represents perhaps the most exciting frontier in the field. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA expression collectively constitute a dynamic regulatory layer that interfaces with the primary MEFV genotype to modulate disease expression. The demonstration that colchicine can influence epigenetic marks suggests that current therapies may have broader mechanisms of action than previously appreciated and opens the possibility of developing epigenetically targeted therapeutic strategies. Future research integrating multi-omics approaches, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, in well-characterized patient cohorts will be essential to fully delineate the molecular determinants of FMF severity and treatment response. Such efforts hold the promise of advancing personalized medicine approaches for FMF and may have broader implications for the understanding and management of other autoinflammatory conditions.</p>
