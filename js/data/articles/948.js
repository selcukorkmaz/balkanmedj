The aim of this study is to identify the effects of different risk factors on mortality after a hip fracture in elderly Turkish patients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Two-hundred forty patients (&gt;60 years; mean age 76.0&plusmn;8.2 years) who were operated for fracture of the hip from 2001 to 2006 were investigated. Demographic data, preoperative length of hospital stay, anesthesia type and ASA physical status, albumin level at admission and comorbidities were recorded.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: Mean albumin level was 3.45&plusmn;0.62 g/dl. Onehundred eight (45%) had hypoalbuminemia. The difference between mortality rates of normo- and hypoalbuminemic patients were not significant at one and two-year. According to preoperative length of stay; one-year mortality was significantly higher in male patients (p=0.015) while two-year mortality was not. One-year mortality was related with high ASA physical status scores (p=0.002) while two-year mortality was not (p=0.169). According to gender; one-year mortality was found higher in men (p=0.001).</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Due to comorbidities, high ASA scores are common in elderly patients. Since the preoperative evaluation in high ASA physical status is longer, this may prolong the preoperative hospital stay. Delay after admission and high ASA physical status are important predictors of mortality for elderly hip fracture patients.</span></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
