	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We investigated the association between the frequency of Trichomonas vaginalis and using intrauterine contraceptive device (IUD).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: A total of 1058 vaginal swab samples were collected. The study population included 402 symptomatic and 656 asymptomatic women, between 18-45 years of age. Specimens were taken with a speculum and sterile cotton swabs from the posterior fornix of the vagina. Wet mount preparations were examined first, and then inoculated into Trypticase-yeast extract-maltose medium.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: T. vaginalis was determined in 35 (3.31%) samples out of 1058 specimens using both diagnostic methods (direct examination and/or culture). While a total of 402 women were symptomatic, 656 women were asymptomatic. Among 190 IUD users, the frequency of T. vaginalis was determined as 6.84%, and among 868 non-users, this ratio was determined as 2.53%. Moreover, while among 100 symptomatic women with IUD, 11 women were positive for T. vaginalis (11%), of the 302 symptomatic women without IUD, 17 were positive (5.63%) for T. vaginalis. Significant correlation was determined between the use of IUD and the presence of T. vaginalis (p&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results showed that IUD use may increase the growth of T. vaginalis in the vaginal mucosa. To reduce the incidence of this pathogen in IUD users, they should be followed up closely.</p>
