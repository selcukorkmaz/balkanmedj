In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of fibroblast growth factor-9 (FGF-9) on in vitro embryonic development in rats.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: The pregnant Wistar albino rats were killed by ether overdose at 9.5 days of gestation and the embryos (average of 10 embryos from each pregnant rat) were removed from the mother. In order to assess the effect of the FGF-9 on total embryonic growth, the embryos were divided into 4 groups. The control group (Group I) embryos were cultured in whole rat serum. Experimental groups (Group II-IV) were cultured in the presence of 1, 2 and 4 &mu;g anti-FGF-9/per ml in whole rat serum.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Total morphologic score in the control and Groups II-IV were 59.6&plusmn;0.51, 43.7&plusmn;1.94, 42.4&plusmn;13.52 and 29.2&plusmn;10.97 respectively. There was a significant regression in the research group in the total morphologic score, yolk sac diameter, crown-rump lengths and somite number when compared to the control group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusions</strong>: In the embryonic period, lack of FGF-9, which is produced by the embryo, could cause embryonic malformations.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
