The immobilization resulting from motor weakness in hemiparetic patients has adverse effects on bone tissue. In this study, the relationship between functional disability and bone mass was investigated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Forty-one left hemiparetic patients (13 women, 28 men; mean age 59.5&plusmn;14.2 years; range 16 to 78 years) who were hospitalized for the first time after stroke for rehabilitation were recruited. Motor recovery was evaluated according to the Brunnstrom stages (BR), and spasticity was assessed according to the modified Ashworth index. Activities of daily living and functional disability were evaluated by the Barthel Index (BI). Bone mineral content (BMC) was measured by dual X- ray absorptiometry in the forearm and femur on both nonparetic and paretic sides.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: On the paretic side, BMC values of both the forearm and femur were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05). Bone mineral content showed a positive correlation with BR scores and BI (p&lt;0.05). We did not find any significant association between BMC values and the Ashworth index (p&gt;0.05). The neuromotor improvement and independency level of the patient were found to be in relationship with the bone mass.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Loss of BMC due to hemiparesis may be prevented with an effective treatment resulting in functional improvement. This may be helpful in protecting the patient from secondary complications of low bone density.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
