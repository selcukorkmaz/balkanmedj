The Cd-treated group was injected subcutaneously with CdCl2 dissolved in saline in the dose of 2 ml/kg/day for 30 days, resulting in a dosage of 1 mg/kg Cd. The rats in the QE treated groups were given QE (15 mg/kg body weight) once a day intraperitoneally starting 2 days prior to Cd injection during the study period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The renal histology in Cd-treated rats showed mesangial expansion, thickening of capsular basement membranes, glomerular basement membranes and tubular basement membranes, characterized by an increase in periodic acid Schiff (PAS)-positive areas as compared with control animals. With the QE treatment, despite the presence of only a few swollen glomeruli, we noticed a marked protection of renal structure when compared with the Cd-treated rats. Furthermore, QE pretreatment resulted in increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunoreactivity and decreased the activity of Terminal Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: These findings suggest that QE may attenuate Cd-induced renal toxicity.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
