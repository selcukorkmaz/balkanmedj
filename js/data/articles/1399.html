	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The potential protective and therapeutic effects of taurine, melatonin and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which are recognized as antioxidant agents, in cadmium chloride (CdCl2)-induced lung injury were compared.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 9 groups. During the 3 months treatment period, group 1 received drinking water, group 2 200 ppm CdCl2, group 3 200 ppm CdCl2 and 1% taurine, to, group 4, 200 ppm CdCl2 and 0.02% melatonin, and group 5 received 200 ppm CdCl2 and 0.5% NAC all added into drinking water in each group. After, groups 6, 7, 8 and 9 received 200 ppm CdCl2 in their drinking water for 3 months, group 6 was given drinking water, group 7, 4% taurine, group 8, 0.08% melatonin and group 9, 2% NAC, each for 7 days.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Melatonin and NAC which were given for protective purposes, increased the decreased glutathione levels. The 3 substances that were administered for both protective and therapeutic purposes, decreased the increased malondialdehyde levels, one of the end products of lipid peroxidation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Taurine, melatonin and NAC play protective and therapeutic roles in CdCl2 induced lung injury.</p>
