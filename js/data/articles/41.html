	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background:</strong>&nbsp;Foreign bodies in the upper aerodigestive tract are frequently seen in otolaryngological practice, but migration of an ingested foreign body to the neck is a very rare condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report:</strong>&nbsp;We present a 66-year-old woman admitted to our outpatient department with a painful neck mass. She had a history of emergency department admission 4 months prior with odynophagia after eating chicken meal. A physical examination revealed a painful and hyperemic mass on the left neck. Antibiotherapy did not relieve the patient&rsquo;s symptoms and signs. A 3-cm linear foreign body was observed in X-ray and computed tomography scans. The symptoms of the patient were relieved after excision of the foreign body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion:&nbsp;</strong>Although it is a rare situation, migration of a foreign body ingested through the aerodigestive tract to the neck should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with neck masses.&nbsp;</p>
