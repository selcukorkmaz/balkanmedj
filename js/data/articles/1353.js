Mean birth weight was 3020&plusmn;715 gr. 93% of the cases were AGA and 78.6% were first child of the family. Mean age of mothers was 28&plusmn;5.4 years. 57% of the cases were born by cesarean and 57% were referred to our hospital from different hospitals. The most common presenting complaint was fever and refusing sucking; and mean application time was 5.5&plusmn;4.6 days. On the admission, mean weight loss was 14.5&plusmn;9.1%, serum sodium level 158.5&plusmn;14 mEq/L, serum urea level 73&plusmn;109 mg/dl, serum creatinine level 1.2&plusmn;2.1 mg/dl, and serum osmolarity 338&plusmn;35 mOsmol/L.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It was remarkable that the cases were mostly first babies and born by cesarean section. A possible solution for hypernatremic dehydration would be to provide breast feeding consultancy to mothers.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
