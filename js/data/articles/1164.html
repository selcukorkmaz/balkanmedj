	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The aim of this study was to evaluate the nutritional status of adolescent male students in rural and urban areas of Edirne, Turkey.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients </strong>and Methods: In a sample of 1004 male adolescent boys (mean age 14.4&plusmn;1.7 years; range 12 to 17 years), intake of macronutrients and micronutrients was assessed from three-day self-reported food records.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: It was observed that energy, calcium, magnesium, vitamin A, E, thiamine, folic acid and fiber intakes of the subjects were below the recommended levels, while protein, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and iron intakes exceeded the target levels. Distribution of macronutrients in daily energy consumption was in agreement with the recommended ratios. Nutritional status did not differ between rural and urban areas (p&gt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The dietary recommendations and menu samples based on these findings may help the male adolescents living in our region and our country have a more balanced nutritional status than before.</p>
