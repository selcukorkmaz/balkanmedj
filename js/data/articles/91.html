	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Background</strong>: The Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) is the most frequently observed painful pathology of the oral mucosa in the society. It appears mostly in idiopathic form; however, it may also be related with systemic diseases like Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s Disease (BD).</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Aims</strong>: Determining the prevalence of RAS and BD in the Northern Anatolian Region, which is one of the important routes on the Antique Silk Road.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Cross-sectional study.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Overall, 85 separate exemplification groups were formed to reflect the population density, and the demographic data of the region they represent. In the first stage, the individuals, who were selected in random order, were invited to a Family Physician Unit at a certain date and time. The dermatological examinations of the volunteering individuals were performed by only 3 dermatology specialists. In the second stage, those individuals who had symptoms of BD were invited to our hospital, and the Pathergy Test and eye examinations were performed.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Results</strong>: The annual prevalence of RAS was determined as 10.84%. The annual prevalence was determined to be higher in women than in men (p=0.000). It was observed that the prevalence was at the peak level in the 3rd decade, and then decreased proportionally in the following decades (p=0.000). It was also observed that the aphtha recurrence decreased in the following decades (p=0.048). The Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s prevalence was found to be 0.60%. The prevalence in women was found to be higher than in men (0.86% female, 0.14% male; p=0.022).</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: While the RAS prevalence ratio was at an average value when compared with the other societies; the BD prevalence was found as the highest ratio in the world according to the literature.</p>
