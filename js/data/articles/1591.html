	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Endeavors to improve medical education should aim to obtain students&#39; contribution, participation, and views. Standardized student feedbacks are widely used in this respect. This study presented our experience with the formation and validation of feedback questionnaires specific to our faculty.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Issues of the questionnaire were determined at a meeting discussion of lecturers and academicians from various departments of the faculty. Then, the best expressing items of these issues were discussed and formulated. Those that were on educational environment were included into a separate questionnaire. The evaluation of the lessons was designed so that lessons with or without practical sessions were inquired by different questionnaires. A fiveitem Likert scale was used for the answers. All the questionnaires were then administered for validation to the first three graduate classes taking final exams of the fall term in the 2002-2003 educational period.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The reliability of the scales (Cronbach alpha) for the evaluation of the lessons with and without practical sessions was found as 0.9047 in 1.000 respondents, and 0.8018 in 967 respondents, respectively.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The questionnaires were found eligible for routine use in drawing the students&#39; contributions to the improvement of education and educational environment.</p>
