												        						<p>An 81-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, a 4-year history of forgetfulness, 2-year low backache, and an in situ pacemaker was admitted to the geriatric service with cellulitis and sepsis-induced delirium. Following successful sepsis management, he continued to report significant low backache and showed discomfort upon hip examination. Routine labs showed serum creatinine of 1.3 mg/dl, serum calcium of 7.6 mg/dl (corrected), and serum phosphate of 2 mg/dl. His serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D level was 5.3 ng/ml (normal: 20-40 ng/ml) with an intact parathormone (PTH) level of 119 pg/ml (normal: 10-65 pg/ml), suggesting vitamin D deficiency and likely reactive PTH elevation. Plain X-rays showed no fractures, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of the lumbar spine and femoral neck gave a T-score of -1.9. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels (1,670 U/l) without hepatobiliary disease on ultrasound prompted consideration of bone metastases, though low serum calcium posed a diagnostic dilemma. A whole-spine computed tomography (CT) scan with bilateral hips revealed degenerative changes in the cervico-dorso-lumbar spine, reduced height in the D9 and L5 vertebrae with some ill-defined lytic areas, but no soft tissue involvement. The skull CT scan, however, revealed diffuse cranial mixed lytic-sclerotic lesions (<a href="javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2662_0.jpg', 640, 480)"><b>Figure 1</b></a>). Possible diagnoses included hyperparathyroidism, multiple myeloma, and fibrous dysplasia, but imaging favored Paget&rsquo;s disease of the bone as the likely diagnosis.<sup>1</sup> The patient received intravenous zoledronic acid (5 mg), resulting in marked improvement in back pain and tenderness. After 3 months, he remains pain-free with serum calcium and alkaline phosphatase levels of 9.2 mg/dl and 110 U/l, respectively.</p>
<p>Paget&rsquo;s disease of the bone is the second most common metabolic bone disorder after osteoporosis.<sup>2</sup> It has an initial osteoclastic phase of resorption followed by an osteoblastic phase of disorganized, structurally weak bone formation.<sup>2 </sup>Paget&rsquo;s disease is most common in individuals of British descent and is considered rare among Asians, including Indians.<sup>3</sup> Additionally, many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis.<sup>4</sup> In this case, the diagnosis arose incidentally while investigating potential malignancy. Paget&rsquo;s disease should be considered in cases of isolated elevated alkaline phosphatase without hepatobiliary disease, with vitamin D deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, and malignancy ruled out.<sup>5</sup> This case was complicated by the coexistence of vitamin D deficiency, probable reflex elevation of PTH, and the patient&rsquo;s ethnicity, where Paget&rsquo;s prevalence is low. However, typical CT findings and a significant clinical response to zoledronate confirmed the diagnosis. The normalization of alkaline phosphatase levels and sustained symptom improvement on follow-up supported this diagnosis.</p>
