<h3>Case Presentation</h3>
<p>A 28-year-old woman was referred to the pulmonology department for evaluation of incidental bilateral pulmonary nodules detected on a chest radiograph performed as part of a preemployment health screening. She was a nonsmoker with no respiratory symptoms, no weight loss, and no fever. Her significant medical history included a mandibular ameloblastoma diagnosed at age 19, which had been treated with segmental mandibulectomy and reconstruction with a free fibula flap. Histopathological examination of the surgical specimen at the time had confirmed a follicular ameloblastoma with clear resection margins. She had been followed postoperatively with annual panoramic radiographs, with no evidence of local recurrence over the subsequent 9 years.</p>
<p>Chest radiography revealed multiple bilateral, well-defined, round pulmonary opacities of varying sizes (Figure 1a). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the chest confirmed the presence of numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules, ranging from 5 to 28 mm in diameter, with smooth margins and homogeneous soft-tissue density (Figure 1b). The nodules were distributed in both lungs without a predominant lobar predilection. There was no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, no pleural effusion, and no evidence of cavitation or calcification within the nodules. Positron emission tomography-CT demonstrated low-grade fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the larger nodules (maximum standardized uptake value 2.4), which was considered indeterminate.</p>
<p>Given the history of ameloblastoma and the imaging findings, CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy was performed on the largest nodule in the right lower lobe. Histopathological examination revealed nests and strands of odontogenic epithelium arranged in a follicular pattern, with peripheral columnar cells exhibiting reverse nuclear polarity and central stellate reticulum-like cells (Figure 1c). The morphological features were identical to those of the original mandibular ameloblastoma. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63 and negative for thyroid transcription factor-1, confirming the diagnosis of metastatic ameloblastoma to the lungs.</p>
<p>A multidisciplinary tumor board discussion concluded that surgical metastasectomy was not feasible given the bilateral and multifocal nature of the disease. The patient was initiated on close surveillance with serial CT imaging every 3 months. At 12-month follow-up, the nodules demonstrated slow interval growth (largest nodule increasing from 28 to 32 mm), consistent with the characteristically indolent behavior of metastatic ameloblastoma.</p>
<p>Ameloblastoma is a benign but locally aggressive odontogenic tumor that arises from the epithelial remnants of the dental lamina. Although classified as a benign neoplasm, ameloblastoma has a well-documented, albeit rare, potential for distant metastasis, occurring in approximately 2-5% of cases. The lungs are the most common site of metastasis, followed by regional lymph nodes, bone, and visceral organs. Metastatic ameloblastoma retains the histological appearance of the primary tumor without features of malignant transformation, distinguishing it from ameloblastic carcinoma. The latency period between primary tumor treatment and detection of metastases can be remarkably prolonged, ranging from 3 to over 30 years. This case underscores the importance of long-term pulmonary surveillance in patients with a history of ameloblastoma, as pulmonary metastases may remain asymptomatic for extended periods and may be discovered incidentally.</p>
