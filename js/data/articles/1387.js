The most frequent symptom was shortness of breath (65.3%), and the second was cough (63.8%). These symptoms aggravated while patients were dusting. Sensitivity to at least one allergen was observed in 59.7% of the patients. Sensitivity to a single allergen was present in 18.9% and to multiple allergens in 40.8% of all patients. The most frequent allergy was determined to house dust mite (39.8%) and was followed by allergy to tree pollens (26%). Sensitivity rate to D. Farinea was 33.7% and 32.7% to D. Pteronyssinus.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: House dust mite were the primary causes of sensitization in patients presenting with allergic symptoms in the Thrace region. The fact that the symptoms aggravated in 46.9% of the patients while they were dusting at home, seemed to support this finding.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
