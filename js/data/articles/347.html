	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: It is well known that mucosal changes and alterations in liver function occur in the experimental obstructive jaundice model.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: We aimed to evaluate the effect of resveratrol on obstructive jaundice-induced changes in the small bowel mucosa and liver using ischaemia-modified albumin as a marker of oxidative damage.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Animal experimentation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: The study used a rodent experimental model of obstructive jaundice, including a sham group (1), a control group (2), and a study group (3). Wistar albino rats were used. Jaundice was produced by ligation of the bile duct in Groups 2 and 3. In Group 3, resveratrol was administered intraperitoneally for 14 days.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: In terms of the structure and the size of the mucosal villi, significant thickening and blunting were detected in Group 2 compared with Group 1. These changes were significantly less noticeable in Group 3 compared with Group 2. Levels of ischaemia-modified albumin were significantly higher in Group 2 compared with those in Group 1, and they were significantly decreased in Group 3 compared with Group 2.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Resveratrol administration to obstructive jaundiced rats reduced the organic effects of obstructive jaundice on small bowel mucosa and liver oxidative stress. We believe that this reduction might attenuate bacterial translocation and systemic effects of secreted cytokines. (Balkan Med J 2014;31:95-99).</p>
