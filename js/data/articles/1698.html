	<strong>Background</strong>: Mucosal melanoma is a rare malignancy arising from melanocytes of the mucosal surfaces. The pattern and frequency of oncogenic mutations and histopathological biomarkers have a role on distinct tumour behaviour and survival.<br />
	<strong>Aims</strong>: To assess the rate of C-KIT positivity and its effect on survival of surgically treated sinonasal malignant melanoma patients with other histopathological biomarkers and clinical features.<br />
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Retrospective cross-sectional study.<br />
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Seventeen sinonasal malignant melanoma patients with a mean age of 65.41 (39-86) years were included. Overall survival and disease-specific survival rates were calculated. The impact of age, gender, stage and extent of the disease, type of surgery, and adjuvant therapies were also taken into consideration. The effect of mitotic index, pigmentation, S100, HMB-45, Melan-A and C-KIT on survival were evaluated.<br />
	<strong>Results</strong>: Median tumour size was 20 mm (interquartile range=27.5 mm). Pigmentation was present in 7 (41.2%) cases. Median number of mitoses per millimetre squared was 11 (interquartile range=13). Melan A was positive in 7 (41.2%) patients, ulceration was present in 6 cases (35.3%), and necrosis was present in (47.1%) 8 cases. Six patients (35.3%) were positive for S100, 14 (82.4%) specimens stained positive for HMB-45 and C-KIT (CD117) was positive in 9 cases (52.9%). Three patients (16.7%) developed distant metastasis. Five year overall and disease free survival rates were 61.4% and 43.8%, respectively.<br />
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although C-KIT positive sinonasal malignant melanoma patients (52.9%) can be candidates for targeted tumour therapies, the studied clinical or histopathological features along with C-KIT seem to have no significant effect on survival in a small group of patients with sinonasal malignant melanoma.</p>
