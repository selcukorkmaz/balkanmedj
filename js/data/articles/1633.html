	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: To collect and evaluate the students&#39; views on practice hours of &ldquo;Introduction to medical practice&rdquo;, which has recently been included in the curriculum of phase I sessions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study</strong> <strong>Design</strong>: The South East Thames (SETh) Short Interactive Course rating scale was administered to the students at the end of each practical session. The scale included 18 items, each of which was responded by one of the five choices and rated between 1 and 5. A mean score above 3 was considered to reflect a positive opinion.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The overall mean score for practical sessions was 4.02. The responses to Item 13 (I want to know more about this subject) received an average score greater than 4 points from all practices.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The students&#39; feedback was affirmative concerning the recently added lecture to the curriculum. Use of student feedback by curriculum lecturers as an educational tool will improve the quality of teaching.</p>
