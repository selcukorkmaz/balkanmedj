A technique that noninvasively evaluates the soft tissue changes in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis patients has not been defined.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: To assess nasal mucosal changes and measure the submucosal fibrosis in allergic rhinitis patients with sonoelastography.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case control study.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: Eighty-eight turbinates of 44 patients were included in the study. There were 23 prick test positive allergic rhinitis patients. The control group constituted 21 patients. The rhinitis quality of life questionnaire and the visual analogue scale were applied to the allergic rhinitis patients. A higher visual analogue scale score indicated more severe allergic rhinitis symptoms. Sonoelastographic measurements were made from the lateral nasal wall. The propagation speed of sound waves was recorded in m/s. The presence of asthma and the type of allergic rhinitis (seasonal or perennial) was noted.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Ten patients had seasonal allergic rhinitis and thirteen patients had perennial allergic rhinitis. Six patients (26.1%) had accompanying asthma along with allergic rhinitis. The median visual analogue scale score was 7 (3-9) in allergic rhinitis patients. The median symptom duration was 7 (1-24) months. The median quality of life questionnaire score was 3.39 (1.68-5.43) points. The median sonoelastography scores of allergic rhinitis patients and healthy subjects were 2.38 m/s (0.9-4.47) and 2.42 m/s (1.62-3.50), respectively. Sonoelastographic measurements of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis patients did not differ significantly (p&gt;0.05). The presence of asthma did not have a significant impact on the elastography measurements (p&gt;0.05). However, regression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation (coefficients: B=0.005, standard error=0.097, beta 0=0.008) between the visual analogue scale and sonoelastography scores (p&lt;0.05).<br />\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Sonoelastography was not suitable as a diagnostic tool in allergic rhinitis. Reduced sonoelastography scores were measured in more symptomatic patients. Higher visual analogue scale scores could be an indicator of disease severity.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
