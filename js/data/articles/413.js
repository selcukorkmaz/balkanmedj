We aimed to investigate the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) level and MMP-9 gene polymorphism in sleep apnea patients with or without cardiovascular disease.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case-control study. Material and Methods: Two hundred nine patients [Mean age (&plusmn;SD), 47 (&plusmn;12) yrs; M/F, 170/39] diagnosed with sleep-disordered breathing were included in the study. Serum MMP-9 level was performed using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) and MMP-9 gene polymorphism with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. We divided the patient group into two subgroups: (1) patients with confirmed cardiovascular disease, i.e. CV-P Group and (2) patients without cardiovascular disease, CV-N Group. We compared all parameters between the two groups.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: There were 56 OSAS patients with cardiovascular disorder (CV-positive group) and 153 OSAS patients without cardiovascular disorder (CVnegative group). CC, CT and TT genotype distributions between groups were similar [31 (55%), 25 (45%), 0 (0%) vs 88 (57%), 61 (40%), 4 (3%); respectively, p&gt;0.05]. MMP-9 level was significantly higher in CV-P patients (442.7&plusmn;139.3 pg/mL) than in CV-N patients (364.4&plusmn;165.0 pg/mL; p=0.0018).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results showed that the presence of MMP-9 polymorphism was not associated with cardiovascular disease. MMP-9 level was higher in OSAS patients with cardiovascular disorders than without cardiovascular disorders. Finally, MMP-9 genotype was not associated with serum MMP-9 levels.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
