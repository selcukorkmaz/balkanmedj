Solitary fibrous tumors are mesenchymal lesions that arise at a variety of sites, most commonly the pleura. Thoracic forms are generally asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis, and the radiographic features are a well-circumscribed, peripheral mass that abuts the pleural surface, frequently attached by a pedicle.

	Solitary ﬁbrous tumors are mesenchymal lesions that arise at a variety of sites, most commonly the pleura. Most patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, with lesions being detected incidentally. Nevertheless, some patients present due to symptoms from local tumor compression (eg. of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma). Furthermore, radiological methods are not always conclusive in making a diagnosis, and thus, pathological analysis is often required. In the past three decades, immunohistochemical techniques have provided a gold standard in solitary ﬁbrous tumor diagnosis. The signature marker of solitary ﬁbrous tumor is the presence of the NAB2-STAT6 fusion that can be reliably detected with a STAT6 antibody. While solitary ﬁbrous tumors are most often benign, they can be malignant in 10-20% of the cases. Unfortunately, histological parameters are not always predictive of benign vs malignant solitary ﬁbrous tumors. As solitary ﬁbrous tumors are generally regarded as relatively chemoresistant tumors; treatment is often limited to localized treatment modalities. The optimal treatment of solitary ﬁbrous tumors appears to be complete surgical resection for both primary and local recurrent disease. However, in cases of suboptimal resection, large disease burden, or advanced recurrence, a multidisciplinary approach may be preferable. Specifically, radiotherapy for inoperable local disease can provide palliation/shrinkage. Given their sometimes -unpredictable and often- protracted clinical course, long-term follow-up post-resection is recommended.</p>												        					</div>
