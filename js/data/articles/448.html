	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Aim of the study was evaluating arrangement of apical surface differentiation in cross-sections of tuba uterinae in different age groups by scanning electron microscope.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Six groups were created with 36 Wistar rat; 1st group: neonate (1th day) (n=6), 2nd group: young (22nd day) (n=6), 3rd group: prepubertal (4-6 week) (n=6), 4th group: adult (10 week) (n=6), 5th group: premenopausal (8 month) (n=6), 6th group: old (18-20 month) (n=6). Tissue samples examined with scanning electron microscope.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: When surface differentiations of epithelial cells in tubae uterinae from birth to menopause were considered, it was determined that the cell with microvilli are first maturing cells and degenerated by ages first. It was observed that the ciliated cells are last maturing cells and subsisting as a mature cell during the postmenopausal period.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Towards the menopause degeneration in microvillous cells together with lack of secretion may affect sperm nutrition adversely. The increase of ciliated cells in aging may be a physiological result related to the active role of cilia movement in the sperm and early embryo transport against a probable decrease in muscle contraction in aging.</p>												        					</div>
