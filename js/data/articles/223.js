High density lipoprotein (HDL) particles were shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), which is an enzyme that is also protective against HDL oxidation. Previous studies suggested a possible role of decreased PON1 activity or HDL levels in sepsis patients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: The present study was designed to test a hypothesis that higher PON1 activity and HDL-cholesterol levels could predict a better survival in sepsis patients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Observational study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: Venous blood samples were collected from sepsis patients for HDL-cholesterol levels, PON1 activity and cytokine assays (TNF-&alpha; and IL-6) and Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were calculated in order to weight patients&rsquo; disease severity on the day of sepsis diagnosis. Patients were followed-up until the 28th day for any cause intra-hospital mortality. Data were statistically analyzed for effects of study parameters on patients&rsquo; survival.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: In total, 85 patients with sepsis were included in the study. The mean age was 65.2&plusmn;17.9 years and 48 were male; at the end of the 28-day follow-up period, 46 survived. TNF-&alpha; (86.9&plusmn;10.5 vs 118.6&plusmn;16.4) and IL-6 levels (906.7&plusmn;82.7 vs 1323.1&plusmn;54.3) were significantly higher in non-survivors, while PON1 activity (140.7&plusmn;42.3 vs 66.7&plusmn;46.6) and HDL-cholesterol levels (43.6&plusmn;8.1 vs 34.5&plusmn;8.9) were significantly higher in survivors (p&lt;0.001 for all). TNF-&alpha; (r=-0.763) and IL-6 levels (r=-0.947) showed strong negative correlations, PON1 activity (r=0.644) and HDL-cholesterol levels (r=0.477) showed positive correlations with patient survival (p&lt;0.001 for all). Survival estimates significantly favored TNF-&alpha; (Log Rank 59.5, p&lt;0.001) and IL-6 levels (Log Rank 53.2, p&lt;0.001) according to PON1 activity (Log Rank 5.4, p&lt;0.03) and HDL-cholesterol levels (Log Rank 8.3, p&lt;0.005). Regression analyses for relative contributions of parameters to survival showed that higher IL-6 levels (t:-16.489, p&lt;0.001) were the most significant negative factor for survival, and TNF-&alpha; levels (t:-4.417, p&lt;0.001), whereas PON1 activity had a positive effect (t:3.210, p&lt;0.003).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The present study showed that although low PON1 activity and HDL-cholesterol levels were related to mortality, higher levels were not found to be as predictive as cytokine levels for survival.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
