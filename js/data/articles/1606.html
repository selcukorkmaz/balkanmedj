<p>
	Hypertension, being the most widespread chronic disease, causes serious mortality and morbidity with damage to target end organs. The asymptomatic nature of the disease results in delays in the diagnosis, so that life style changes and medical treatment cannot be initiated before disease-related permanent damage has occurred. Since primary care physicians are the first to confront with the disease, they should have adequate and current knowledge to handle the problem. Diagnosis, classification, and treatment of hypertension depend on a continuous, active, and positive relationship with the patient. This article reviews current issues on the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of hypertension for physicians who met the patient first.</p>
