In patients with obstructive jaundice, the absence of intraluminal bile flow causes some alterations and mucosal damage in the gut. In the present study, it was aimed to investigate the effects on BT of high-fat enteral nutrition in bile duct ligated rats.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: In this study, a total of 28 healthy Spraque-Dawley rats, weighing 230-300 gr, were grouped into four as sham group, control group, high-fat enteral nutrition group and low-fat enteral nutrition group. The rats in all the &nbsp;groups were sacrificed on the seventh postoperative day The values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), total and direct bilirubin were measured for biochemical evaluation. Also, &nbsp;samples were taken from the blood, lung, liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes for microbiological evaluation. The results were calculated as CFU/gr and evaluated statistically.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: In all bile duct ligated rats, all findings of obstructive jaundice were observed &nbsp;clinically (in postoperatively third day) and in the laboratory. It was determined that the lymphatic system is an essential pathway for BT, as reported by similar studies. However, &nbsp;it was observed in this study that the high-fat enteral nutrition may be not severely &nbsp;effective in reducing &nbsp;BT in bile duct ligated rats. The results were supported by statistical analyses.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It was observed that high-fat enteral nutrition has no &nbsp;meaningful effects on reducing BT in bile duct ligated rats.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
