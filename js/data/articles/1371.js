The expected remission probabilities in 10 cycles were calculated in a cohort simulation with 10,000 trials, in a cohort in remission in the initial state.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Markov models are effective prediction models when the timing of events is important, when the decision problem involves risk over time and when events may happen more than once (as in recurrence). Markov models can be used in estimating such events. As a result of derived model, the remission probability without relaps of any case treatrd with St. Jude Total Therapy XIIIB protocol in ALL disease in the second cycle was found as 43% and it was sharply reduced after this cycle.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cost, effectiveness, and health-related quality of life criteria of clinical strategies can be synthesised by the help of Markov models and used in the calculation of life expectancy, quality adjusted life expectancy and lifetime cost.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
