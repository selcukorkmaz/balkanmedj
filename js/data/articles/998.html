	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	As the population increases worldwide, the number of elderly patients who present with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with ST-segment elevation will continue to grow. Thrombolytic therapy (TT) is applied in patients with AMI with ST-segment elevation and aged no more than 75 years. It is recommended percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or by-pass surgery to elderly patients. For PTCA and by-pass surgery there has to be a prepared cardio-surgery medical team, which can be found in big medical hospitals. Patients with AMI with ST-segment elevation over 75 years, which has no TT applied, are with suspicious prognosis for longevity and quality of life. Along with its needed effects TT may cause some unwanted effects such as incidence of major (fatal) or minor bleeding.</p>
