	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Utero-cutaneous fistula (UCF) is an extremely rare entity and only a few case reports have been published. Most UCFs develop secondary to postpartum or postoperative complications.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case</strong> <strong>Report</strong>: A 42 year-old woman began to complain from bleeding and malodorous discharge through her abdominal incision scar. The fistula tract with a thickness of 8 mm was observed between the uterus and wound using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The risks and benefits of conservative treatment have been discussed; the patient demanded definitive treatment, so hysterectomy and excision of the fistulous tract was performed. Histopathology of the fistulous tract showed endometrial epithelization of the tract lined by granulation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: There are many causes of such an extremely rare entity. Patients should be counseled for medical or surgical treatment considering their age, accompanied uterine pathologies such as fibroids and fertility expectations.</p>
