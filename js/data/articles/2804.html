												        						<p>According to the Journal Citation Reports 2024 data released on June 18, 2025, the Balkan Medical Journal achieved an impact factor of 3.8, the highest in its 46-year history.<sup>1</sup> Having entered the SCI-Expanded index in 2008, the Balkan Medical Journal was ranked Q4 between 2007 and 2015, Q3 between 2016 and 2020, and became T&uuml;rkiye&rsquo;s first Q2 general medicine journal between 2021 and 2023.<sup>2,3</sup> With its 2024 impact factor, it was promoted to Q1. This accomplishment not only elevated the Balkan Medical Journal to 50<sup>th</sup> place in the medicine category but also made it T&uuml;rkiye&rsquo;s first Q1 general medicine journal.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>Following this remarkable milestone, the number of articles submitted to our journal increased substantially, particularly during the second half of 2025. While the total number of submissions was 1,677 in 2024, this figure rose by 77% to 2,968 in 2025. There was also a marked increase in submissions from abroad. The proportion of international submissions, which stood at 33% in 2024, reached 55% in 2025 (<a href="javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2804_0.jpg', 640, 480)"><b>Figure 1</b></a>). The countries contributing the most articles outside T&uuml;rkiye were, in order, China, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia.</p>
<p>The growing number of submissions has led to longer waiting times for articles in our journal. This situation causes delays in the scientific community&rsquo;s access to new research and poses challenges in meeting authors&rsquo; expectations. To address this, the editorial board decided that beginning from 2026, the Balkan Medical Journal will be published monthly, with 12 issues per year, to ensure faster dissemination of knowledge and greater author satisfaction. Furthermore, the Balkan Medical Journal, which currently appears in both online and print formats, will be published exclusively online starting in 2026 to protect the environment and reduce economic costs.</p>
<p>We hope this decision will be beneficial for our journal, our authors, and our readers.</p>												        					</div>
