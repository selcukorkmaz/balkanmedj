Percentages of phosp hatid ylino sitol -4,5- bisph ospha te&nbsp;3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (11%), B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (8%), and neurofibromatosis type 1 (6%) mutations&nbsp;were higher than those reported in the literature. Males had a higher rate&nbsp;of Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog mutations (P = .102),&nbsp;whereas epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were statistically&nbsp;more common in females (P = .001). Multiple variants of strong significance&nbsp;were identified in 6.3% patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma,&nbsp;most of whom were smokers. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene&nbsp;homolog and phosp hatid ylino sitol -4,5- bisph ospha te 3-kinase catalytic&nbsp;subunit alpha mutations were most commonly observed.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study shows that Turkish patients have higher rates&nbsp;of PIK3CA, BRAF and NF1 mutations compared to the literature.&nbsp;Studies to determine the molecular profile specific to Turkish people&nbsp;will guide clinicians in treatment and contribute significantly to determining&nbsp;priorities in diagnosis.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
