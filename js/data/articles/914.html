	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Several studies have linked nephrolithiasis with an increased risk of renal pelvis cancer but an association between nephrolithiasis and risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has not been apparent, as only a few cases of RCC developing with nephrolithiasis have been reported. Herein, we report a case of bilateral RCC, which developed in a patient who had bilateral renal calculus, which was previously managed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, percutaneous nephrolithotripsy, and open surgery. All patients with a long standing history of urolithiasis should undergo close scrutiny of the parenchyma for the possibility an occult renal cancer by using appropriate investigations.</p>
