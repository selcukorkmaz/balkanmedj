	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Recent studies have reported contrasting results regarding the association of polymorphisms in two integrin genes, ITGA2 and ITGB3, with ischemic stroke.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between the ITGA2 C807T and ITGB3 T176C polymorphic loci with ischemic stroke, as well as plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case control study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Human venous blood samples were collected from patients admitted for ischemic stroke (n=350, &lsquo;patients&rsquo;) and healthy individuals (n=300, &lsquo;controls&rsquo;). Blood was genotyped at these loci by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels were measured by routine enzymatic, masking, and turbidimetry methods.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: As expected, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein were all significantly higher in patients than in controls (p&lt;0.05). Genotype and allele frequencies of ITGA2 C807T were significantly different between patients and controls (p&lt;0.05), but no difference was detected in genotype or allele frequencies for ITGA3 T176C. For ITGA-2, the T allele conferred a 1.226 times higher relative risk of ischemic stroke than the C allele (odds ratio=1.226, 95% confidence interval=1.053&ndash;1.428). Similarly, total cholesterol was higher in T allele carriers than in non-carriers (p&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: ITGA2 C807T polymorphism is associated with ischemic stroke, with the T allele acting as a susceptibility allele that appears to confer increased cholesterol levels.</p>
