This nerve innervates the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior belly of the digastric muscle. This case report highlights one possible variation in the course of the nerve. In the case presented here, mylohyoid nerve traveled within mandibular canal in the right side of a mandible on routine dissection of a 49-year-old male cadaver. The position of the canal and nerves within the mandible was assessed from dental cone-beam computed tomography images and by dissection after imaging. The right hemi-mandible was cut into eight serial, and the nerve was observed to travel within the mandibular canal in the 5th, 6th and 7th bony slices. The nerve can be damaged during surgical procedures of the mandible such as osteotomy and salivary gland operations. In addition, accessory innervation of anterior and posterior mandibular teeth pulp by sensory components of the mylohyoid nerve is thought to be one reason for the failure of anesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve. Clinicians should be aware of complications that may arise from a mylohyoid nerve travelling within the mandibular canal.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
