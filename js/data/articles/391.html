	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Vocal fold hyperplastic lesions are premalignant lesions that can be treated effectively by removal of the lesions surgically.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of this study was to discuss the success of surgery in patients with vocal fold hyperplastic lesions in terms of preserving vibratory function by comparing the preoperative and postoperative videolaryngostroboscopy findings.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: The medical charts and videolaryngostroboscopic recordings of patients diagnosed with hyperplastic lesions on the vocal folds were reviewed retrospectively.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Twenty seven patients with unilateral lesions who underwent type1 subepithelial cordectomy were enrolled in the study. The videolaryngostroboscopic recordings were evaluated by three raters who were not the operating surgeon and who were blinded to the histology of patients. To evaluate the videolaryngostroboscopic findings, a form, which is a modification of criteria described by Hirano and Bless, was used. Preoperative and 6th month postoperative videolaryngostroboscopic recordings were compared with each other and with recordings of the control group, which included 50 healthy volunteers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: All videolaryngostroboscopic findings, except false cord vibration, were significantly improved after surgery.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The principle of vocal fold surgery in patients with benign lesions is to preserve the vibratory tissue. This principle also applies to patients with hyperplastic lesions that are premalignant. The hydrodissection technique may be beneficial for this purpose.</p>
