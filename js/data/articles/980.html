	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Morningness-eveningness preference stands for interindividual chronobiological differences. This study was designed to investigate if prenatal testosterone exposure is a candidate for having a causal role in sexual dimorphism observed in circadian typology.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Materials and Methods</strong>: A total of 183 students (111 females, 72 males; mean age 20.7 years) were involved in the study. Circadian typology was assessed using the Horne-Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire. Digit lenghts were measured with digital calipers and digit ratio (2D/4D) was calculated by dividing the length of the second digit by that of the fourth digit.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: Circadian typology assessment revealed 54 morning-(29.5%), 100 intermediate-(54.6%) and 29 evening-(15.8%) type students. Digit ratio of both hands in males were significantly lower than females (p&lt;0.001). Digit ratio for both hands in morningness trait were significantly higher than intermediate (p&lt;0.001) and eveningness (p&lt;0.05 for the left and p&lt;0.01 for the right hand) traits. Morning type was more common among females (35.1% vs 20.8%; p&lt;0.05). Higher digit ratio was significantly associated with the morning type for both of the hands in both genders.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Prenatal testosterone exposure, represented by digit ratio (2D/4D) as a proxy marker, seems to have a causal role in sexual dimorphism observed in the circadian typology preferences.</span></p>
