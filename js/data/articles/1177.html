	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	A 76-year-old woman weighing 114 kg presented with shortness of breath and worsening chest pain for 2-year duration. There was no history of trauma. Plain and cross-sectional imaging identified a giant anterior diaphragmatic hernia which caused cardiac posterior shifting. She was transferred to general surgery department for further investigations and treatment. Reduction of herniated contents and repairing of bilaterally diaphragmatic defect were performed via laparotomy. Bilateral, giant Morgagni hernia which causes cardiac shifting to the backward is extremely rare.</p>
