A significant number of patients are non-responsive or intolerant to the domestic drug colchicum dispert.<br /><strong>Aims:</strong> To compare the efficacy and side effects of colchicum dispert and colchicine opocalcium in children with FMF.<br /><strong>Study Design:</strong> Cross-sectional study.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> A total of 29 children with FMF who used colchicum dispert for at least 6 months initially and colchicine opocalcium for another consecutive 6 months were included. Sex and gender equity in research was considered. Clinical features, visual analog scale for pain scores, exercise-induced leg pain, and FMF severity scores with laboratory parameters were evaluated for both the treatment periods. Bristol stool chart and number of stools per 24 hours were recorded to compare the gastrointestinal side effects.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> The major indication was non-responsiveness in 18 patients (62%) and intolerance in 11 patients (38%). Usage of colchicine opocalcium (significantly higher dosage than colchicum dispert) showed statistically significant beneficial effects on the number and duration of attacks, visual analog scale for pain, exercise-induced leg pain scores, and FMF severity scores (p&lt;0.05 for each parameter). Bristol stool chart questionnaire scores decreased from 5.62&plusmn;1.56 to 4.15&plusmn;1.73 points, and the scores of daily stool number decreased from 0.46&plusmn;0.894 to 0.03&plusmn;0.118 points (p&lt;0.05). There were 12 patients who benefited from the switch without a change in dosage, and the clinical features were significantly better with the colchicine opocalcium treatment.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Pediatric patients with FMF, who have active disease and/or gastrointestinal complaints during the use of colchicum dispert, may benefit from colchicine opocalcium.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
