	<strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne, multi-systemic infectious disease that is thought to be wide spread in Turkey even though studies on its seroprevalence are limited.<br />
	<strong>Aims</strong>: To determine the seroprevalence of Lyme borreliosis in part of north-eastern Tur-key (in the city of Trabzon), and to identify possible relationships between seropositivity and various factors such as location, gender, age group, occupation, income, and educational level.<br />
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Retrospective cross-sectional study.<br />
	<strong>Methods</strong>: A total of 884 blood samples collected from provincial and district health centers serving a population of about 800,000 were included in this study. ELISA was used to determine the anti-Borrelia IgG antibody levels in the samples. Samples that yielded positive results by ELISA were further subjected to western blot (WB).<br />
	<strong>Results</strong>: IgG antibodies were found in 128 samples (14.5%). Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between age groups and educational levels in terms of the incidence of seropositivity, whereas location, gender, occupational group and income level had no effect (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, p=0.948, p=0.645, p=0.131, p=0.080 respectively).<br />
	<strong>Conclusions</strong>: The risk of contracting Lyme borreliosis in Trabzon is high, and necessary measures need to be taken to avoid the spread of disease.</p>
