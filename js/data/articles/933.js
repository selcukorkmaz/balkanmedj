To the strangulated hernia groups surgical induction of strangulated intestinal obstruction was performed. Tissue and blood samples were taken at 30 minutes (group 2), 2nd hour (group 3), 4th hour (group 4) and 6th hour (group 5) respectively, and then LDH, CPK, ALP, AST, ALT, D-dimer levels and blood cells counts were measured and histopathological examination was done.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: Focal mucosal necrosis accompanied was confirmed by histological findings in the strangulated intestinal ischemia group after second hour. Serum D-dimer, ALT, ALP, CPK levels and neutrophil count became elevated at second hour, which was statistically significant.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In patients with hernia, after reduction of the intestinal hernia, raised levels of serum D-dimer, ALT, ALP, CPK levels and neutrophil count may indicate the presence of a bowel ischemia. However, more comprehensive clinical studies are required to evaluate the potential survival benefit by using the laboratory tests as a marker and/or a useful diagnostic tool of the need for laparotomy.</span></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
