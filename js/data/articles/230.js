Four cases had neck masses and three cases had oropharyngeal masses. Prenatal sonography was used as the main diagnostic tool for all patients. The median gestational age was 34.5 weeks at the time of diagnosis and 36 weeks at delivery. Polyhydramnios was observed in three of the seven cases and they were delivered prematurely. Interventions such as endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy were performed to provide patency of the airway during delivery by the EXIT procedure in three cases. Hemangioma was found in two cases, teratoma in two cases, lymphangioma in two cases and hamartoma in one case following pathological examination of the masses.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The localization of mass, its characteristics, invasion (if it exists), and relation to the airway are the main factors used to determine the need for EXIT. The presence of polyhydramnios may be an important indicator to predict both the need for EXIT and fetal outcomes.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
