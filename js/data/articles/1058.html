	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: In our study, we examined the urinary system explained in the first printed Turkish anatomy book &ldquo;Mirat&uuml;&#39;l Ebdan fi Teşrih-i Aza&uuml;&#39;l İnsan&rdquo;, and the urinary system existing in the contemporary anatomy reference books. With the results of our study, we aimed to provide a reference on the development of Turkish medicine and anatomic history for today&#39;s anatomists.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Urinary system explanations of Şanizade&#39;s work were translated into today&#39;s Turkish. The information on urinary system included in Mirat&uuml;&#39;l Ebdan fi Teşrih-i Aza&uuml;&#39;l İnsan was compared with the information on the same topic existing in today&#39;s modern anatomy reference books.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Mirat&uuml;&#39;l Ebdan fi Teşrih-i Aza&uuml;&#39;l İnsan consists of several parts on urinary system, which are kidney, capsulitis and vesica urinaria. The information about ureter is given under the part on kidney. Initially, positions of the organs, and then the physiognomy and internal structures are covered. Notably, we determined that the internal structure of kidney and the vein system is expressed in detail.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Şanizade used Ottoman Turkish terminology when he translated the original foreign source. He expressed the knowledge of his time in the best way. There are numerous points that correspond to contemporary knowledge on urinary system.</p>
