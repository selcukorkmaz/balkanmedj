	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Different foreign bodies were found in rectum in three male patients, whose ages were 25, 66 and 67. These foreign materials were iron stick, special wooden stick and tea cup. In two patients, materials were taken out under general anesthesia in lithotomy position and the other one in knee-elbow position by anal dilatation under local anesthesia with sedation. In two patients there were not any complications related with the treatment method but one of them had superficial lacerations on rectal mucosa. All of the patients were discharged after 24 hours observation. Foreign bodies in rectum and sigmoid colon is increasingly being seen recently and is one of the significant surgical emergency problems due to the complications it may cause.</p>
