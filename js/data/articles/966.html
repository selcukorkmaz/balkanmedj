<p>
	Trichotillomania, defined as an irresistible urge to pull and pluck one&#39;s own hair, is categorized as an impulse control disorder not otherwise specified in DSM-IV-TR. This behavior is performed in response to a number of emotions such as increasing temper or anxiety and gives resultant tension relief. Our case is an 11-year-old boy who showed signs of pulling his hair overnight and bedwetting when he was sleeping. Polysomnography was performed on him overnight during sleep to differentiate epileptic discharge, for a differential diagnosis. The results were within normal limits. The initial diagnosis of trichotillomania was discussed and we concluded that it would be more appropriate to evaluate the case under the diagnosis of parasomnia.</p>
