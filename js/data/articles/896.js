In the culture medium consisting of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), MSCs can grown easily. To obtain insights into their ex-vivo expansion, the role of the autologous serum (OS) on growth and differentiation capacity of human bone marrow MSCs in comparison to cells grown in FBS was studied.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Material and Methods</strong>: MSCs were cultured by using a RPMI-1640 medium consisting of 10% FBS, and OS 10%, 5%, 3% and 1%. Equally, 1x106/mL cells were incubated into each flask. Cell count, viability, and flow cytometry studies were done at every passage after completing detachment in the cultures.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: 10% OS group was found to be superior compared to the other study groups as regard to cell count and isolation. In addition, it has been observed that similar resuts were found in 5% OS and 10% FBS groups. Immunophenotyping analysis of the cells revealed no statistical difference between the groups. MSCs isolated from all study groups were successfully differentiated into adipogenic lineages except 3% and 1% OS groups.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The expansion potency from bone marrow-derived MSCs was maintained in culture media using 10% and 5% OS.</span></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
