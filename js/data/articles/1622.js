Two hours before surgery, a pre-emptied TNG tape and a TNG tape of 50 mg were applied on the back of operative hands in group I and II, respectively, and IVRA was performed. All patients received 2% prilocaine of 3 mg/kg diluted in 40 ml of serum saline. The onset and recovery times of sensory and motor blocks, quality of anesthesia, dryness of the operation field, heart rates, mean arterial pressures, and oxygen saturation were recorded after 1, 5, 10, 20, and 40 minutes of local anesthetic injection.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The onset of sensory block was significantly shorter and motor block recovery time was significantly longer in group II (p&lt;0.05). No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to quality of anesthesia, dryness of the operation field, heart rates, mean arterial pressures, and oxygen saturation (p&gt;0.05).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our data show that transdermal nitroglycerin exerts beneficial effects on sensory and motor blocks in IVRA.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
