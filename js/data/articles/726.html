	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Pressure sores are an important source of complications in patients who are immobilized and bedridden. We aimed to investigate the efficiency of magnetic field treatment in pressure sores.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: This was a randomized, double blind controlled design study. 20 patients in the study group received magneto-therapy, once a day for 30 minutes and with 150G, keeping to the BTL09 magnetotherapy device&#39;s program. In the control group, 20 patients received the dressing only once a day. The surface areas of the pressure sores were evaluated at the onset of the treatment (1st day), and on the 7th and 15th days.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: When within group comparisons were conducted, a significant difference was observed between the 1st and 7th day, 7th and 15th day, and 1st and 15th day measures in both the groups in terms of the scar area. The average healing time for the treatment group was 10.80&plusmn;4.06 (6-20) days, and the average healing time for the control group was 18.85&plusmn;9.75 (5-32) days. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (z=-2.114, p=0.034). Also, there was a significant difference in the scar area between the two groups in the 15th day measure (z=-3.818, p=0.000).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The healing process of the tissue can be accelerated.with the use of magnetotherapy in the treatment of pressure sores of stage II and III.</p>
