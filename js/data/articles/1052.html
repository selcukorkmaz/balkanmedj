	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The etiopathogenesis of preeclampsia has been shown to include the existence of vascular damage with endothelial dysfunction being the most directly related with development of the disorder. Elevated total homocysteine and lipoprotein(a) are risk factors for endothelial dysfunction and vascular diseases. We compared serum total homocysteine and lipoprotein(a) levels in healthy pregnant women and preeclamptics and investigated the relationship between these parameters.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods:</strong> Total homocysteine and lipoprotein(a) levels in serum of 28 women with preeclampsia and 25 normotensive women were measured by chemiluminescence and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods, respectively. Both groups were composed of third trimester pregnants.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Concentrations of total homocysteine (&mu;mol/L) were significantly higher in women with preeclampsia than in normotensive pregnants. [8.54&plusmn;4.76 vs. 4.85&plusmn;1.50, (mean&plusmn;standart deviation), respectively; p&lt;0.001]. But no significant difference in lipoprotein(a) values (mg/dL) was observed in preeclamptics compared with matched healthy pregnants (Geometric mean: 4.15 mg/dL in preeclampsia vs. 2.30 mg/dL in controls).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: There is a 1.8 fold increase in serum total homocysteine in preeclampsia compared to normotensive pregnants, which may cause vascular endothelial dysfunction. Circulating lipoprotein(a) is not significantly elevated in preeclamptics and thus is unlikely to play a role in the pathophysiology of this disorder. Key words: Preeclampsia; homocysteine; lipoprotein(a).</p>
