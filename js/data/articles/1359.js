The causes of this food poisoning were investigated in this study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: Patients had symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, weakness, fever, nausea and vomiting. Cultures for bacteria were obtained from the food and patients. Microbiologic and epidemiologic study was performed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Salmonella typhimurium (n=18) and Shigella dysenteria (n=25) were isolated in the samples obtained from the cases, but bacteria weren&#39;t isolated from food samples.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The food poisoning occured most likely as a result of contamination of water containers in which the food was washed. Food products should be washed in fresh and clean water to prevent further poisoning incidents.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
