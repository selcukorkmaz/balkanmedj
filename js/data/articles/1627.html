	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Manual therapy has been used in the treatment of pain and dysfunction of spinal and peripheral joints for more than a hundred years. Manual medicine includes manipulation, mobilization, and postisometric relaxation techniques. The aim of manual therapy is to enhance restricted movement caused by blockage of joints keeping postural balance, restore function and maintain optimal body mechanics. Anatomic, biomechanical, and neurophysiological evaluations of the leucomotor system is essential for safe and effective applications of manual therapy. Serious complications may occur unless manipulation techniques are performed by licensed and specialized physicians who are competent in identifying indications and contraindications, and in choosing the proper technique. In this review, the concept of manual medicine and applications of manual therapy are revisited.</p>
