												        						<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s syndrome is considered as a syndrome because of its diverse clinical expressions. Patients with Beh&ccedil;et disease have been subclassified into various clusters on the basis of clinical expressions (1). The reason for the existence of different types of clusters in Beh&ccedil;et syndrome is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Similar to that of most diseases, genetic and environmental factors participate in the pathogenesis of Beh&ccedil;et syndrome. The exact contribution of these factors to the emergence of Beh&ccedil;et disease, however, is unknown. Therefore, I conducted a basic study that is based on a simple questionnaire to examine the hypothesis <em>&ldquo;Beh&ccedil;et disease</em> <em>patients in the same family generally accumulate in similar clinical clusters&rdquo;</em>. The questionnaire used in this study had been previously evaluated in a large cohort (2). However, I wanted to reassess the hypothesis in my Beh&ccedil;et disease cohort.</p>
<p>Given that patients with Beh&ccedil;et syndrome have heterogeneous clinical expressions and universal diagnostic criteria for Beh&ccedil;et disease do not exist, I used the International Study Group Criteria for Beh&ccedil;et Disease criteria to standardize the study group (3). Thus, all patients in the study fulfilled International Study Group Criteria for Beh&ccedil;et Disease criteria. I also clinically subclassified the patients to one Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s syndrome cluster. As previously described, these Beh&ccedil;et disease clusters included the mucocutaneous, vascular, enthesis&ndash;arthritis&ndash;acne, and eye disease clusters (1). Additionally, I classified patients into neurologic, intestinal, and undetermined clusters for clinical purposes. This study was approved by the local research ethics committee and performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.</p>
<p>Eighty-five patients and their relatives provided consent to participate in this study. First, I re-evaluated the family histories of patients with Beh&ccedil;et disease. Then, I asked patients the question <em>&ldquo;Do you have any first- or second-degree relatives with one </em>Beh&ccedil;et disease<em>-related symptoms, including oral and genital ulcers, eye disease, cerebral events, skin lesions, vascular thrombosis, hemoptysis, or pulmonary symptoms?&rdquo;</em> Lastly, I interviewed the relatives of the patients that replied to the latter question in the affirmative or have been already diagnosed with Beh&ccedil;et disease. I checked their symptoms against International Study Group Criteria for Beh&ccedil;et Disease criteria and subclassified participants who fulfilled International Study Group Criteria for Beh&ccedil;et Disease criteria to a Beh&ccedil;et disease cluster.</p>
<p>The patients were classified most frequently to the mucocutaneous cluster and then to the eye cluster. Furthermore, 22 (25.9%) of the patients had first- or second-degree relatives with Beh&ccedil;et disease. The enthesis&ndash;arthritis&ndash;acne cluster had the highest frequency of family history. No apparent accumulation of similar findings in index Beh&ccedil;et disease cases and their close relatives was observed (<a href="javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/table_BMJ_2068_0.jpg', 640, 480)"><b>Table 1</b></a>). Karaca et al. (2) previously showed that only the papulopustular and arthritis cluster may show familial clustering.</p>
<p>The results of these studies did not provide support for my first hypothesis that <em>&ldquo;Beh&ccedil;et disease patients in the same family generally accumulate in similar clinical clusters&rdquo;</em>. Nevertheless, genetics may have a major role in the emergence of Beh&ccedil;et disease given that it is accepted as a member of a group of diseases called major histocompatibility complex-1 opathy (4). Furthermore, on an epigenetic level, DNA methylation in several gene loci is related to Beh&ccedil;et disease. Similar to that of most diseases, genetic background (e.g., alterations in major histocompatibility complex-1 related genes) is insufficient for the full-blown expression of Beh&ccedil;et disease. I have a second hypothesis that even against a similar genetic background, multiple and separate hits of environmental or non-genetic factors may participate in the pathogenesis of Beh&ccedil;et disease. Environmental factors may also alter DNA methylation. The signs of Beh&ccedil;et disease are expressed individually at a time during ensuing relapses. For example, in the vascular cluster, different types of vascular involvements usually manifest at each successive relapse (5). Under these circumstances, different environmental factors may be the cause of separate relapses and further new-onset findings. Therefore, the multiple hit of non-genetic factors may determine the characteristics of full-blown disease.</p>
