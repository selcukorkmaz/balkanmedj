	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Acute gastroenteritis remains a common cause of hospital emergency room visits in Albania. However, the aetiology of severe gastroenteritis leading to hospitalization in adults frequently remains unclear.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: Our objective was to study the epidemiology and causes of community-acquired, acute gastroenteritis in adult patients presenting to hospital.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Cross sectional study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: A prospective study was conducted from January 2010 to January 2012, among patients &ge;15 years old with community-acquired gastroenteritis presenting to the emergency room of the University Hospital &ldquo;Mother Theresa&rdquo; in Tirana, Albania. Stool samples and rectal swabs were collected from the patients for microbiological testing.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The median age of the study patients was 33 (15-88) years and 577 (58%) were females. The median age of males was 35 (15-87) years. The vast majority of cases occurred in urban area (849, 85%), p&lt;0.01. Patients were admitted throughout the year with peak admissions for patients infected by bacterial pathogens in summer and those affected by viral pathogens in autumn. A total of 917 (91.7%) patients underwent a laboratory examination. The overall isolation rate was 51%. Bacterial pathogens were found in 29%, viral pathogens in 19% and protozoal pathogens in 2.5% of patients. No aetiological agent or other cause of acute diarrhoea was found in 449 (49%) patients. Twenty-nine (3.2%) patients were hospitalized.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Despite extensive laboratory investigations, enteropathogens were detected in only 51% of adult patients who presented to the hospital ER with acute gastroenteritis. Viral infections ranked as the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in adults.</p>
