	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Pharyngeal-cervical-brachial (PCB) variant is a rare form of Guillan-Barre Syndrome (GBS). Antibodies against other membrane proteins like GM1b and GD1a have been found only in a small number of patients with Guillan Barre syndrome variant.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case</strong> <strong>Report</strong>: Here, we report a 5.5 year-old boy diagnosed early with positive GD1a and GD1b gangliosides of Guillan-Barre syndrome pharyngeal cervical-Brachial variant, who improved and recovered fully in a short period. This is in contrast to those whose recovery period prolongs in spite of early diagnosis and appropriate treatment and/or those who experience incomplete recovery.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In summary, diagnosis of PCB variant of GBS should be considered in infants with sudden onset bulbar symptoms and muscle weakness, and it should be kept in mind that early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can give successful outcomes.</p>
