	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation (AARS) is an uncommon lesion seen mainly in children and adolescents. A retrospective analysis of 12 patients with AARS treated non-operatively is presented in this study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Twelve patients with AARS who were treated non-operatively were evaluated retrospectively in terms of recent trauma and respiratory tract infection history, accompanying injuries, radiological findings, duration of symptoms, amount and duration of traction and clinical results of the treatment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Traumatic AARS was &nbsp;present in 8 patients. No evidence of trauma was found in 4 patients. Type I subluxations in 10 and type II subluxations in 2 patients were found according to the &nbsp;Fielding and Hawkins classification. All patients were treated using bed-side mentooccipital tractions. The mean duration of bed-side mentooccipital traction was 3,75 days and the mean amount of load was 1.8 kg. All patients were kept in Philadelphia collars for additional 3 weeks after the clinical recovery. No limitations and pain in head movements were present in any patient at the sixth month follow-up examinations.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Paediatric patients with neck pain and torticollis should be investigated concerning trauma and recent respiratory tract infection history in order to avoid any delay in diagnosis of a possible AARS.&nbsp;</p>
