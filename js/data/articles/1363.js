Our aim was to evaluate the descriptive characteristics of CMM.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Fifty-five patients with malignant melanoma (32 males, 23 females; mean age 50.9&plusmn;12.9; years, range 26 to 76 years) were evaluated retrospectively. Surgical excision alone was performed on stage I and II patients. Regional lymph-node dissection was performed together with surgical excision on patients with palpabl lymph nodes (stages III and IV) detected during preoperative examination. Descriptive characteristics such as anatomical locations, histological subtypes and stages of the CMM were examined; the tumor size and thickness, adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy rates, local recurrence rates were evaluated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Palpabl lymph nodes were identified in 74% (n=41) of the patients. Lymph-node dissection was performed together with surgical excision on these patients. The average tumor thickness and tumor size were 2.1&plusmn;1.3 mm and 21.7&plusmn;11.6 mm respectively.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Width of surgical margins and wide surgical resection with lymph-node dissection for CMM will have no effect on loco-regional recurrence, distant metastases and survival rates. The complications and benefits must be meticulously evaluated before application of lymph-node dissection.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
