	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis thThis study was planned to investigate the antipneumocystis activity of terbinafine in a rat model.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Rats were obtained from the Hakan &Ccedil;etinsaya Experimental and Clinical Research Institutions, Erciyes University, Kayseri, Turkey. Terbinafine administered orally in doses of 40, 80, 120 and 160 mg/kg/day after nine weeks of immunosuppression with dexamethasone to facilitate the development of acute Pneumocystis carinii penumoniae (PCP).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Untreated animals showed P. carinii infection levels with a mean (&plusmn;standard deviation) log number of cysts per gram of lung tissue of 4.6&plusmn;1.6 at the end of the experiment. Terbinafine administered at a dose of 160 mg/kg/day significantly reduced the log number of cysts per gram to 2.2&plusmn;1.5. The therapeutic efficacy of terbinafine administered at 160 mg/kg/day (log 2.2&plusmn;1.5 cysts/lung) was similar to that obtained with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), 50/250 mg/kg/day (p&lt;0.001). A reduction in the number of cysts was also observed in infected animals treated with 80, and 120 mg of terbinafine/kg/day, although the results were not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In our model, the efficacy of terbinafine in PCP has been found to be dose dependent.</p>
