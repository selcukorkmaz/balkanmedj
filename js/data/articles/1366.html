<p>
	Spleen is well fixed on the left side of diaphragm with peritoneal bonds. Wandering spleen is a rare medical condition with its yet unknown pathogenesis. Wandering spleen is mostly located in lower abdomen or pelvis. Diagnosis is difficult if it is not suspected. Spleen can often be palpated in lower abdomen. Rarely it can be symptomatic when there is torsion of splenic vascular pedicle and splenectomy should be performed in this case. We report and evaluate a case who underwent splenectomy due to torsion of wandering spleen resulted in acute abdomen with a review of relevant literature.</p>
