	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: High-grade transformation or dedifferentiation in carcinoma is progression of a low-grade malignant neoplasm to a high-grade carcinoma or poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. This is rarely observed in adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary glands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: A 39 year-old woman presented with a painless mass at the left submandibulary region that had been growing slowly for 5 years. Submandibulary mass resection revealed a mass with peripheral adenoid cystic carcinoma and a central high-grade tumor delineated with a fibrous rim, raising the possibility of a hybrid or composite carcinoma, requiring differential diagnosis depending upon morphology and immunohistochemistry findings. The final histopathological diagnosis was high-grade transformation of adenoid cystic carcinoma. After surgical therapy, the patient was irradiated to the neck and submandibulary region. No sign of tumor recurrence has been evident for 36 months.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: This present case seems to be another rare case with high-grade transformation of adenoid cystic carcinoma and the fibrous rim may be a histopathological feature of such cases, which should be kept in mind.</p>												        					</div>
