	<strong>Background</strong>: Paediatric HIV infection is different from the adult type of disease in many ways, including transmission routes, clinical findings and treatment strategies.<br />
	<strong>Aims</strong>: To evaluate clinical data of paediatric patients with HIV disease.<br />
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Retrospective cross-sectional study.<br />
	<strong>Methods</strong>: The charts of 22 paediatric patients diagnosed with HIV infection in our clinic during a 14 year period through 2001-2015 were retrospectively analysed. Clinical data, laboratory findings, treatment modalities and outcomes were recorded.<br />
	<strong>Results</strong>: The mean age of diagnosis 61.9&plusmn;49.2 months and the mean follow-up period was 60.3&plusmn;37.5 months. Seven patients (31.8%) were foreigners and the most common transmission route was vertical transmission (n=16, 72.7%). The most common presenting symptom and the sign were history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (n=8, 36.4%) and lymphadenopathy (n=12, 54.5%), respectively. Recurrent pneumonia (n=6, 27.3%), prolonged fever (n=5, 22.7%), recurrent otitis media (n=4, 18.2%), and gastroenteritis (n=4, 18.2%) were other clinical symptoms. Other than bacterial sinopulmonary infections, tuberculosis was the most frequent opportunistic infection (n=3, 13.6%). Mortality occurred in two patients (9.1%).<br />
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although mostly vertically transmitted,&nbsp; HIV infection&nbsp; may be diagnosed throughout the childhood. Frequently encountered signs and symptoms may be the reason for doctor admission. High clinical suspicion together with detailed anamnestic data and physical findings constitute the basis for pediatric HIV diagnosis.</p>
