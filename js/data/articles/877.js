Both groups were randomly organized. The students had two standardized patient encounters in addition to training and debriefing sessions. The study group students received face-to-face feedback after the first encounters; but not the control group. We used the motivation dimension of Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire and t-test to evaluate the differences between the average scores of motivational levels of both groups for all sub-dimensions.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: After the first encounters, there is a significant difference between study and control groups in the sub-dimension of test anxiety (p=0.028). After the second encounters, the students of the study group who received feedback after the first encounters, got lower scores in the sub-dimension of test anxiety (p=0.016), and got higher scores in the subdimension of self-efficacy (p=0.027).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We found out that the students who received feedback had lower levels of test anxiety, and higher levels of self-efficacy. Those results showed that standardized patient feedback eafected student motivational levels in two sub-dimensions.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
