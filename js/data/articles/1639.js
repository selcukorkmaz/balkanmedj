Parsley (Petroselinum crispum) contains many antioxidants such as flavanoids, carotenoids and ascorbic acid.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: In this study, the histopathological and biochemical results of nutrition with a parsley-rich diet in terms of eliminating stress-induced oxidative gastric injury were evaluated.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Animal experimentation.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: Forty male Wistar albino rats were divided into five groups: control, stress, stress + standard diet, stress + parsley-added diet and stress + lansoprazole (LPZ) groups. Subjects were exposed to 72 hours of fasting and later immobilized and exposed to the cold at +4 degrees for 8 hours to create a severe stress condition. Samples from the animals&rsquo; stomachs were arranged for microscopic and biochemical examinations.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Gastric mucosal injury was obvious in rats exposed to stress. The histopathologic damage score of the stress group (7.00&plusmn;0.57) was higher than that of the control group (1.50&plusmn;0.22) (p&lt;0.05). Significant differences in histopathologic damage score were found between the stress and stress + parsley-added diet groups (p&lt;0.05), the stress and stress + standard diet groups (p&lt;0.05), and the stress and stress + LPZ groups (p&lt;0.05). The mean tissue malondialdehyde levels of the stress + parsley-added group and the stress + LPZ group were lower than that of the stress group (p&lt;0.05). Parsley supported the cellular antioxidant system by increasing the mean tissue glutathione level (53.31&plusmn;9.50) and superoxide dismutase (15.18&plusmn;1.05) and catalase (16.68&plusmn;2.29) activities.<br />\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Oral administration of parsley is effective in reducing stress-induced gastric injury by supporting the cellular antioxidant defence system.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
