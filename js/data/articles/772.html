	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an easy and safe procedure for long-term enteral feeding in children with inadequate oral intake. Although PEG has been used for treatment of gastric volvulus in adults, there is a little relevant data for its use in children. Here, we report a 17-month-old male infant who was admitted to our hospital with a 1-month history of vomiting. Upper gastrointestinal contrast study revealed an organoaxial gastric volvulus. Then PEG was inserted for the purpose of nutritional support. Because the patient continued to vomit after feeding via gastrostomy, surgery was planned. Laparotomy revealed that the entry of the PEG tube was at the posterior wall of the stomach. The gastrostomy tube was removed, and the opening was repaired. Then the stomach was repositioned, and Nissen fundoplication and a Stamm gastrostomy at the anterior wall of the stomach were performed. The patient had no further episodes of vomiting after surgery and was discharged following an uneventful recovery period.</p>
