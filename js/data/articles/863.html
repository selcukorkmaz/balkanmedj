	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Leuconostoc spp, a member of the Streptococci family, was found to cause infection in humans in 1985. These infections have been reported in patients who had received vancomycin to treat their underlying diseases.</p>
<p>
	Nosocomial meningitis caused by Leuconostoc spp. was diagnosed in our patient. An extraventricular drainage system catheter was used due to the presence of a thalamic hematoma with ventricular extension. Central nervous system infections due to Leuconostoc spp. are rare. To our knowledge, our case is the sixth case worldwide and the second case reported from Turkey. This case is reported here to draw attention to a rare infectious agent with a high mortality risk.</p>
