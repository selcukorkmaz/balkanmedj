	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	The trachea is an uncommon site of metastasis from colorectal carcinoma. A few cases have been reported in the literature, but these focused mostly on the clinical aspects without detailing radiologic and histologic findings. The authors describe a 70-year-old woman who was diagnosed with tracheal metastasis from a primary rectal cancer. We present the contrast-enhanced chest computed temography (CT), including volume-rendered image, as well as bronchoscopic findings.</p>												        					</div>
