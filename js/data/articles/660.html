	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim was to determine the frequency of postpartum depression (PPD), its correlates and the effect on the quality of life.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: This study was conducted among 708 mothers having a child aged 2 weeks-18 months. A questionnaire on descriptive features and PPD risk factors; Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale and WHOQOL-BREF quality of life scale were used for the data collection.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The rate of PPD frequency was 15%. The gestational age, mental problems and anxiety during pregnancy, emotional changes in the premenstrual period, past depression/PPD history, depression/PPD history in the family, satisfaction with the marriage, thinking that the baby affected the marriage adversely were the factors related with PPD. The quality of life was lower in women with PPD than those without PPD.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The frequency of PPD is quite high and PPD is decreasing the quality of life of the mother.</p>
