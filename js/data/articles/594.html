	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Mallampati scoring is the most common examination method for predicting possible intubation problems. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship of facial anthropometric measurements with the modified Mallampati score (MMS).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: The study population consisted of 153 male and 170 female volunteers (mean ages, 48,9&plusmn;16,9 and 44,1&plusmn;15,4 years, respectively). All participants were subjected to Mallampati scoring and facial anthropometric measurements during pre-operative visit. Anthropometric measurements included inter-incisor gap, lower face height, thyrogonial length, thyromental distance and bigonial distance. The relationship of anthropometric measurements with the MMS was investigated by statistical analysis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Bigonial distance showed a positive correlation with the MMS (r=0.857; p&lt;0.001), whereas inter-incisor gap, lower face height, and thyromental distance showed negative correlations (r=-0.809, r=-0.738, and r=-0.762 respectively p&lt;0.001 for all). ROC and AUC analysis showed that the BGD level had the highest significant AUC (p&lt;0.001). Optimal cut-off point for BGD was &gt;113 mm, and at this cut-off point, the sensitivity rate was 94.8% and the specificity rate was 95.9%. BGD was the best predictor for discriminating MMS 3-4.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We suggest that facial measurements such as bigonial distance may be used as alternatives for Mallampati evaluation when the patient&#39;s condition is not suitable for Mallampati scoring.</p>
