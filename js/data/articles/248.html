	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Oesophageal perforation is a life-threatening pathology that is generally treated conservatively; however, surgical procedures are frequently performed. A topical haemostatic agent, Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS), also has beneficial wound-healing effects.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: This study aimed to determine the effects of ABS following experimental oesophageal perforations.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Animal experiment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: The experimental rats were classified into 6 groups (with 7 rats in each group). Pairs of groups (primary repair alone and primary repair + ABS) were terminated in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weeks following injury. The oesophageal perforations, which were 8-10 mm in length, were created using a nasogastric tube. The perforation sites were repaired with a 6-0 polyglactine thread in the primary repair groups. Additionally, ABS was sprayed over the perforation site in the treatment groups. Each oesophagus was evaluated histopathologically.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: There were fewer microabscesses and areas of necrosis in the ABS groups compared with the primary repair groups. The histopathological evaluation revealed that the ABS groups had less inflammation and more re-epithelisation compared to the primary repair groups (p=0.002 and p=0.003, respectively). Fibrosis in the ABS groups was moderate in the 2nd week and mild in the 3rd week. Comparing the groups with respect to the time intervals, only the 1st week groups showed a significant difference in terms of re-epithelialisation (p=0.044).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Topical ABS application on the repaired experimental oesophageal perforation regions led to positive wound-healing effects compared with the rats that were administered the primary repair alone.</p>												        					</div>
