	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Epididymo-orchitis is a focal form of human brucellosis described in 2-20% of patients with brucellosis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: In this retrospective study, the records of 190 adult male patients (mean age 27.5 years; range 17 to 71 years) with brucellosis were evaluated. Ten of these cases presented with epididymo-orchitis. Among these cases, epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis were diagnosed on the basis of a typical history of gradual onset of scrotal pain and findings of enlarged tender testes and/or epididymis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The most common symptoms were fever, scrotal pain, and swelling (100%). There were different focal Brucellar involvements other than the epididymo-orchitis in eight patients (80%). All of the patients had unilateral epididymo-orchitis. A testicular abscess was detected in one patient. Combined antibiotic therapy was started and continued for 6-8 weeks. Orchiectomy was required for one patient (10%) and granulomatous orchitis was detected in the resected specimens. Relapse was not observed in any patient.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Brucellosis should be considered in the diagnosis of scrotal diseases in endemic areas. Clinical and serological data are sufficient for the diagnosis. Conservative management combined with antibiotic therapy is adequate for managing brucellar epididymo-orchitis.</p>
