	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular diversity and clonal relationship of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains isolated in Western Turkey.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Materials</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: A total of 87 strains isolated between 2006 and 2009, eight of which were rifampicin monoresistant and 79 were multidrug resistant, were analyzed with IS6110 RFLP and spoligotyping methods.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The results of spoligotyping showed that 7% of the strains were orphans, and 8% were undefined for family in the SpolDB4 database. Major families of the strains were LAM (38%), T (35%), Haarlem (7%), Beijing (2%), S (2%) and U (1%) families. The clustering rate by spoligotyping was calculated as 75%. The most predominant SIT cluster was SIT41 (29%). According to the results of IS6110 RFLP, 71 different patterns of IS6110 were observed. Low copy number was found in 26% of the strains. When the results of two methods were combined, the final clustering rate was calculated as 26%.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusions</strong>: The genotypical distribution of drug resistant tuberculosis isolates in our region indicates genetic diversity and the clustering rate was found low in our region. However, more comprehensive and long-term molecular epidemiological studies are needed to control the drug resistant strains.</p>												        					</div>
