	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: This study was carried out to investigate knowledge levels of general practitioners and their thoughts about circumcision in Middle Anatolia.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Materials</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: This descriptive and cross-sectional study was carried out with 247 general practitioners working in Sivas. A questionnaire was prepared by the authors using previous reports. Questionnaires were sent to subjects by post. One hundred and seventy eight general practitioners (57 women, 121 men) responded and were included in the study. For statistical analysis, Chi-square test was used and p&lt;0.05 value was accepted as significant.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: 42.1% of subjects believed that circumcision should be performed between 2 and 6 years of age. 2.2% of subjects declared that circumcision could be done at home and 7.3% believed that the location of the operation is not important. 9.6% of subjects believed that the person who performs the circumcision does not have to be a doctor. 21.3% of subjects believed that circumcision could be performed without anesthesia during the newborn period because of undeveloped pain sensation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study demonstrated that general practitioners, who are the most easily accessible health staff for information about health, do not have updated information about the way to perform circumcision and its necessity. Therefore, it is concluded that education programs about circumcision for general practitioners must be continued and updated.</p>
