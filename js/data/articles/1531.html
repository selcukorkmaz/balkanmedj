	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	The Edirne Province Yearbooks published from 1870 to 1901 are important references giving information about Edirne and neighboring divisions. In the yearbooks, Edirne is depicted from various perspectives. Information was given concerning its minerals and sanative waters, their contents, and the illnesses to which they were believed to be beneficial. We learn from these sources that not only the people living in Edirne, but also those living in other regions showed great interest in the thermal springs. When the thermal spring season started, groups of people visited these places by carriages. Later, transportation was also provided by trains.</p>
