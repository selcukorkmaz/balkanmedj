	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Bilateral multiple typical carcinoid tumors of the lung are uncommon malignancies. We discuss the case of a 64 year-old female with a nonproductive cough as the &nbsp;initial symptom. Thoracic computed tomography revealed multiple nodular lesions on both sides, which were initially misdiagnosed as multiple metastases of the lung with an unknown primary. After resection of nodules in the right hemithorax, pathologic examination revealed a typical carcinoid tumor. Bilateral sequential thoracotomy was performed and all ten nodules, (six on the right side and four on the left side), were treated by sublobar resection due to poor respiratory function. Pathological examination revealed all nodules to be typical carcinoid tumors. Following the resections, the patient has remained disease-free for ten months.</p>
