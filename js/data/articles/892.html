	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Colonic herniation through the esophageal hiatus is an unusual condition. Isolated trans-hiatal herniation of the transverse colon is very rare and only five cases have been reported. All these reported patients were symptomatic, and had dysphagia, epigastralgia, vomiting, dyspnea, cough, or palpitations. Hiatal hernia is an important clinical problem. Because of the severe complications of hiatal hernia, including bleeding, strangulation, and perforation, early diagnosis and treatment are important. A 75-year-old man who had prostate carcinoma was evaluated with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT). In this case, CT findings and clinical emphasis of the incidentally discovered isolated transverse colonic hiatal herniation was reviewed.</p>
