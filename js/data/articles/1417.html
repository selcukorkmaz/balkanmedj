<p>
	Ectopic adrenal tissue is a relatively common finding, especially in children. The most common localization is the male genital system, especially the spermatic cord. Female genital tract is also a common site for ectopic adrenal tissue but, ovarian localization is very rare. A 21-year-old woman presented with complaints of abdominal swelling, pelvic pain and menstrual irregularity. Ultrasonographic examination revealed a 25 cm cystic mass in the left ovarian region. The cyst which was removed surgically, was filled with serous fluid and there was a 0.2 cm yellowish nodule within the wall. Serous cubic epithelium was lining the inner portion of the cyst. The nodule within the cyst wall was well defined and consisted of adrenal tissue.</p>
