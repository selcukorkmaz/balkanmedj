	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by multiple, large renal cysts and impaired kidney function. Although the reason for the development of kidney cysts is unknown, ADPKD is associated with cell cycle arrest and abundant apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: We asked whether serum-soluble TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (sTRAIL) might underlie ADPKD.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design:</strong>&nbsp;Case-control study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Serum sTRAIL levels were measured in 44 patients with ADPKD and 18 healthy volunteers. The human soluble TRAIL/Apo2L ELISA kit was used for the in vitro quantitative determination of sTRAIL in serum samples.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Mean serum sTRAIL levels were lower in patients with ADPKD as compared to the control group (446.9&plusmn;103.1 and 875.9&plusmn;349.6 pg/mL, p&lt;0.001). Serum sTRAIL levels did not differ among stages of renal failure in patients with ADPKD. There was no correlation between serum sTRAIL levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with ADPKD (p&gt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results show that ADPKD patients have depressed sTRAIL levels, indicating apoptosis unrelated to the stage of chronic renal failure.</p>
