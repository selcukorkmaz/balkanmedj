	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	A 59-year old patient was admited to the Gastroenterology Clinic with the signs of gastrointestinal bleeding. Computerized tomography (CT) and a barium-meal radiography revealed a circumferential nodular wall narrowing and incomplete stricture at the D2 part of the duodenum. CT also showed a poorly demarcated mass in the upper and lower poles of the left kidney. During the operation, the whole kidney together with the tumor was removed and &nbsp;also a part of the duodenum. Morphological features of both tumors were typical and distinctive enough to set the diagnosis of two independent primary tumors. The possibility of one being the metastasis of the other was excluded. The diagnosis of double primary malignant neoplasms - renal cell carcinoma and duodenal mucinous adenocarcinoma was made.</p>
