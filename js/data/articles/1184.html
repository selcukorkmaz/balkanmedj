	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Bilateral arcus axillaris was found on a 55-yearold male cadaver in our laboratory of anatomy during routine dissection. This variation which is also called as axillary arch, axillopectoral muscle or axillary arch of Langer could be fibromuscular or muscular. In our case, a fasciculus separating from latissimus dorsi muscle ended at the tendon of pectoralis major muscle after overlying the neurovascular bundle in the axilla. Althought left muscular arch was innervated by intercostobrachial nerves, right muscular arch&#39;s nerve was not identified. It might have caused neurovascular symptoms in the hand, arm and forearm.</p>
