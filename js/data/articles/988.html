<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;">Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE) is a result of an autoimmune reaction in patients who have an apparent or an occult malignancy. Patients often present to hospitals with subacute psychiatric symptoms, memory disturbances and epileptic seizures. Diagnosis was made by the elimination of other possibilities presenting similar symptomatology, cerebral radiologic findings, EEG and CSF examination and most importantly detecting the primary tumor. Our case presented to hospital with multiple epileptic seizures, confusion, and was diagnosed as PLE after radiologic, electrophysiologic and laboratory examination. We thougt that it is worth to report this rare case and discuss it under the light of literature.</span></p>
