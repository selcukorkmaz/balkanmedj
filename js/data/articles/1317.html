	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We evaluated the intraocular pressure (IOP) after trans-Tenon retrobulbar injections of triamcinolone acetonide (TTTA) in patients with with diffuse diabetic macular edema.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: We retrospectively reviewed 30 eyes of 21 consecutive patients (12 females, 9 males; mean age 63.7&plusmn;6.92 years; range 49 to 77 years) who received a single dose of 20 mg TTTA injection for diffuse diabetic macular edema. Intraocular pressures were evaluated before and one week, one month, and three months after the injection.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Elevation of the IOP occurred only during the first week after TTTA injections. These rises returned to normal values with topical antiglaucoma medications. Improvements in visual acuity were significant at one month and three months.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It was concluded that single-dose 20 mg TTTA injection was a safe and effective treatment in diffuse diabetic macular edema.</p>
