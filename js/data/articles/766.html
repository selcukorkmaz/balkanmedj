<p>
	Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) is an uncommon and benign vascular disorder characterized by angiomatous, pink-red papulonodular lesions mainly located on the scalp, neck, and periauricular region. Although the exact cause of ALHE is unknown, several etiologic factors including insect bites or parasites, trauma, hyperestrogen states, and immunologic factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. Only a few cases of pregnancy related ALHE so far have been reported in the literature. In this article, we report a case of ALHE with postauricular location aggravated during the first trimester of pregnancy.</p>
