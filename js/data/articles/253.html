	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Pleomorphic adenomas (PAs) are the most common type of benign salivary gland tumours and usually originate from the major salivary glands. PA originating from the nasopharynx has rarely been reported in the literature.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: A 62 year-old male presented with right aural fullness and subjective hearing loss. Otoscopic examination revealed an opaque and bulging tympanic membrane. Nasal endoscopic examination revealed a smooth mass arising from the right wall of the nasopharynx, obstructing the opening of the right Eustachian tube. The MRI showed a 1.3x2x1.3 cm sharply outlined and lobar mass in the right lateral wall of the nasopharynx. The tumour was meticulously detached from its attachment site and excised via the transnasal route under endoscopic visualisation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We reported pleomorphic adenoma in the nasopharynx in a patient who presented with serous otitis media that successfully resected with transnasal endoscopic surgery and discussed the treatment methods.</p>
