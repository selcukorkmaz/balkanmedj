	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: To determine the factors affecting the severity of menopausal symptoms and the quality of life among women living in Manisa, a western city of Turkey.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: After statistical estimation of the sample size reflecting the whole population, 268 climacteric women (mean age 50.7&plusmn;6.6 years; range 40 to 60 years) with menopausal symptoms were investigated by sociodemographic questionnaire, menopause rating scale (MRS), and Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF-TR) in Celal Bayar University Hospital.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: Almost 1/3 of women had no knowledge on menopause. The MRS scores of women were inversely correlated with Physical Health, Psychological well-being, Social Relationship domains of quality of life. Educational level, menopausal knowledge, participation in decision-making in the family and economic status positively affected most domains of quality of life, whereas being married and having high BMI scores had negative effects.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: In climacteric women, quality of life was negatively affected by the severity of menopausal symptoms, low education level, limited menopausal knowledge, and being overweight.</span></p>
