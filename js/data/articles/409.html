	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Malignant tumours of the sinonasal tract comprise approximately 3% of the malignancies that arise in the upper aerodigestive tract. Approximately 10% of tumours that arise in the sinonasal tract originate in the ethmoid and/or frontal sinuses, and are likely to involve the anterior cranial base. The route of spread of tumours originating in the anterior skull base and paranasal sinuses is determined by the complex anatomy of the craniomaxillofacial compartments. These tumours may invade laterally into the orbit and middle fossa, inferiorly into the maxillary antrum and palate, posteriorly into the nasopharynx and pterygopalatine fossa, and superiorly into the cavernous sinus and brain. Recent improvements in endoscopic technology now allow the resection of the majority of benign neoplasms and some early malignant tumours with minor dural involvement. For advanced-stage malignant tumours and benign tumours with frontal bone involvement, the classical open approaches remain viable surgical techniques. In this paper, we review the open surgical resection approaches used for resections in the craniomaxillofacial area.</p>
