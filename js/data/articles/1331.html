	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-&alpha; and IL-6), and fibrinolytic system parameters (t-PA, and PAI-1) and insulin resistance in obese individuals.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: The study included 54 obese subjects (BMI &ge;30 kg/m2; 41 females, 13 males; mean age 33.5 years) and 30 non-obese healthy individuals (BMI &lt;25 kg/m2; 19 females, 11 males; mean age 22.3 years). Fibrinogen levels were measured by the coagulometric method and the measurements of TNF-&alpha;, IL-6, t-PA and PAI-1 were carried out by the ELISA method.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Compared with non-obese subjects, obese individuals had significantly higher fibrinogen (p&lt;0.01), PAI-1 (p&lt;0.001), TNF-&alpha; (p&lt;0.01), and IL-6 (p&lt;0.001) levels, and significantly lower t-PA level (p&lt;0.001) and t-PA/PAI-1 ratio (p&lt;0.001). We also found an inverse relationship between TNF-&alpha; and t-PA levels (p=0.007) and t-PA/PAI-1 ratio (p=0.016) in obese individuals. The presence or absence of insulin resistance did not affect proinflammatory cytokines and fibrinolytic system parameters in obese individuals.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings indicate increased inflammatory cytokine levels especially in TNF-&alpha; level, and decreased fibrinolysis in obese individuals. These changes may contribute to atherosclerotic process independent from insulin resistance in obesity.</p>
