	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of our study was to investigate the oxidative and antioxidative status of plasma and plasma prolidase enzyme activity on gallstone disease.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Material and Methods</strong>: The study group included 35 patient with gallstone disease and 30 healthy volunteers as control subjects. Plasma prolidase activity and oxidative-antioxidative parameters were measured. Antioxidative status of plasma was evaluated by measuring total antioxidant capacity. To determine oxidative status; total oxidant status and oxidative stress index were deermied.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: Total antioxidant capacity levels of plasma were lower in the patients with gallstone disease than in controls (p&lt;0.001). In contrast, total oxidant status levels and oxidative stress index values were higher in the patients than in controls (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). Beside these, plasma prolidase activity was significantly lower in the patients than controls (p&lt;0.001).</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusions</strong>: The present results indicated that the oxidant parameters increased and antioxidant parameters decreased in patients with gallstones, and that these patients were exposed to oxidative stress.</span></p>
