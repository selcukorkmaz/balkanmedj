	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The aim of our study is to investigate the effects of anemia at the second trimester on birth weight and birth time.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: The medical reports of 1116 pregnant women who attended and delivered at our clinic between January 2005 and October 2007 were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups as having &lt;9 gr/dl hemoglobin or &ge;9 gr/dl hemoglobin levels. The gestational and the perinatal outcomes of the normal and anemic groups were compared.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: The age and the parity were higher in the non-anemic group than in the anemic pregnants. (p=0.03, p=0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in the mode of birth and gestational complications between the two groups. While there was no statistically significant difference in the gestational age at delivery and birth weight, prematurity and oligohydramnios ratios were significantly higher in the anemic group compared to the group with Hb&gt;9 gr/dL (p=0.041, p=0.004, respectively).</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The anemia of second trimester is related with prematurity and increased rate of oligohydramnios. Iron supplementation should be given during pregnancy to improve pregnancy outcomes.</span></p>
