Maximum opening, right-left excursion and protraction degrees were determined with electronic digital inclinometer which was extremely sensitive but practicable. Besides, interincisial distance was measured by using vernier caliper during maximum mouth opening.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The average values for males and females were found as follows: maximum mouth opening 30.58&ordm;, 27.16&ordm;; right excursion 4.96&ordm;, 6.85&ordm;; left excursion 5.40&ordm;, 7.43&ordm; and protraction 13.38&ordm;, 11.85&ordm;, respectively. Interincisial distances were measured as 52.4 mm in males and 52.2 mm in females.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The evaluation of ROM values for the TMJ are important in the diagnostic and treatment of the musculoskeletal and neurological diseases affecting joint movement. We conclude that interincisial distance measurements may be a practical method for the evaluation of the derangements in this joint.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
