	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	A 16-year-old girl presented to our clinic with a nocturnally aggravating pain on her 5th metacarpal bone for approximately one year, which responded well to salicylate medication. Clinical diagnosis of our case was achieved through anamnesis, physical examination, and imaging studies. In plane X-Ray, increased sclerosis in middle 1/3 of the 5th metacarpal bone extending from cortical area to medulla was observed. MRI revealed an intracortical lesion surrounded by increased sclerotic tissue. History of nocturnally aggravating and salicylateresponding pain made us suspect osteoid osteoma for diagnosis. After curettage of the area we thought as nidus, autografting was performed. After excisional biopsy, histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. In our case, we would like to draw attention for the fact that although being a rare localization, osteoid osteoma should be kept in mind in patients with nocturnally aggravating and salicylate-responding pain in metacarpal region, where radiological studies showed an intracortical lesion.</p>
