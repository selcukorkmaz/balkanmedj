<p>
	Bladder cancer is the second most common urological neoplasm of the genitourinary tract, with an increasing incidence in industrialized and developed countries. Massive calcification of bladder tumors are rarely seen on plain radiographs and this appearance may be confused with bladder stones. In this report, we presented a 53-year-old man who was operated on with the diagnosis of a bladder stone seen as a large opacity in the pelvic region on plain radiograph. In exploration, two papillary tumors were found, 10 cm and 2 cm in diameter. The tumors were resected totally. On pathological examination, the tumors were diagnosed as transitional cell carcinoma.</p>
