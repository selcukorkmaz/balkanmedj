	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Spoken word recognition and speech perception tests in quiet are being used as a routine in assessment of the benefit which children and adult cochlear implant users receive from their devices. Cochlear implant users generally demonstrate high level performances in these test materials as they are able to achieve high level speech perception ability in quiet situations. Although these test materials provide valuable information regarding Cochlear Implant (CI) users&rsquo; performances in optimal listening conditions, they do not give realistic information regarding performances in adverse listening conditions, which is the case in the everyday environment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of this study was to assess the speech intelligibility performance of post lingual CI users in the presence of noise at different signal-to-noise ratio with the Matrix Test developed for Turkish language.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Cross-sectional study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: The thirty post lingual implant user adult subjects, who had been using implants for a minimum of one year, were evaluated with Turkish Matrix test. Subjects&rsquo; speech intelligibility was measured using the adaptive and non-adaptive Matrix Test in quiet and noisy environments.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results: </strong>The results of the study show a correlation between Pure Tone Average (PTA) values of the subjects and Matrix test Speech Reception Threshold (SRT) values in the quiet. Hence, it is possible to asses PTA values of CI users using the Matrix Test also. However, no correlations were found between Matrix SRT values in the quiet and Matrix SRT values in noise. Similarly, the correlation between PTA values and intelligibility scores in noise was also not significant. Therefore, it may not be possible to assess the intelligibility performance of CI users using test batteries performed in quiet conditions.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion: </strong>The Matrix Test can be used to assess the benefit of CI users from their systems in everyday life, since it is possible to perform intelligibility test with the Matrix test using a material that CI users experience in their everyday life and it is possible to assess their difficulty in speech discrimination in noisy conditions they have to cope with.</p>
