Constrictive pericarditis results from inflammatory pericardial fibrosis. However, it may also be associated with concurrent medical conditions with an unclear etiology. A rare cause of constrictive pericarditis may be coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), which has been experienced in the recent past and whose effects are still observed. The condition may also be a long-term effect of the vaccine. To raise awareness of this rare cause, we have presented the case of a 33-year-old male with no chronic diseases in this article.</p>\r\n<p>The patient was admitted to our cardiology outpatient department with a history of progressive dyspnea and swelling of the legs for 8 months. He noted that these symptoms began 4 months after developing COVID-19 and 5 months after receiving the coronavirus vaccine. He reported receiving three doses of the mRNA-BioNTech vaccine. He did not have any history of tuberculosis, previous cardiac surgery, radiotherapy, malignancies, or connective tissue diseases. Cardiovascular examination revealed a left-sided apical impulse, 1/6 systolic murmur, and pitting edema (grade 1+) of both lower limbs. Neck examination revealed distension of the jugular veins (Kussmaul&rsquo;s sign). The electrocardiogram exhibited a normal sinus rhythm (47 bpm) and inverted T-waves in the V1-V5 leads. The laboratory tests revealed only a slightly elevated pro-BNP level. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed, and it showed a normal ejection fraction (60%) and a thickened pericardium with septal bounce. Thus, a cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) was performed. The cardiac MR revealed pericardial thickening (7 mm), mild pericardial inflammation, septal bounce, and ventricular interdependence (respiratory) (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2630_0.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 1</b></a>). The echocardiography and cardiac MR findings were suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Thus, right heart catheterization was performed to confirm the diagnosis and plan the operation (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2630_1.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 2</b></a>). Subsequently, pericardiectomy was performed.</p>\r\n<p>Constrictive pericarditis is a condition in which pericardial fibrosis leads to loss of elasticity, which subsequently affects ventricular filling.<sup>1</sup> Numerous factors play a role in the etiology of constrictive pericarditis. It may develop after viral infections or after vaccines that trigger autoimmune events.<sup>2</sup> However, it may also develop in patients with conditions such as microorganisms and systemic conditions such as neoplasia, autoimmune disorders, connective tissue diseases, and renal failure.<sup>3</sup> Neurological conditions such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and clinical conditions such as lymphadenopathies have been reported following a COVID-19 infection or administration of its vaccines.<sup>4,5</sup> As with many diseases, including COVID-19, effective vaccination can reduce disease-related mortality.<sup>6</sup> Currently, the effects of the COVID-19 vaccine and those of the long-term disease remain highly debatable. Cardiovascular conditions are at the forefront of these. Although a few suspected cases have been reported in the literature, awareness of COVID-related constrictive pericarditis in our country is limited.<sup>7,8</sup> In this report, the long-term effects have been discussed in a patient with constrictive pericarditis without any suspicious conditions other than COVID-19 and a vaccination history. In patients with constrictive pericarditis of unknown etiology, even those with a long-term history, a history of COVID-19 or its vaccination should be elicited.</p>\r\n<p>The chronic effects of the COVID-19 disease and its vaccines should be considered because it may play a role in constrictive pericarditis and the etiology of several unexplained diseases.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Written informed consent was obtained from the patient before being enrolled in the study.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Authorship Contributions:</strong> Concept- &Ccedil;.K.; Design- K.Y.; Supervision- &Ccedil;.K., K.Y.; Fundings- &Ccedil;.K., K.Y.; Materials- &Ccedil;.K., K.Y.; Data Collection or Processing- &Ccedil;.K., K.Y.; Analysis or Interpretation- &Ccedil;.K., K.Y.; Literature Search- K.Y.; Writing- K.Y.; Critical Review- &Ccedil;.K., K.Y.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> No conflict of interest was declared by the author.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"reference\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Reference</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>REFERENCES</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Yadav NK, Siddique MS.
