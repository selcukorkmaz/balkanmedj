												        						<p><strong>Background:</strong> Perception of acoustic details in the speech signal is important for speech sound development. The medial olivocochlear pathway, a part of the auditory efferent system, plays a role in stimulus-related control of the cochlea. One clinical tool to evaluate the medial olivocochlear activity, which is thought to improve speech perception in noise, is the suppression of otoacoustic emissions.<br /><strong>Aims:</strong> This study investigated the suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in children with phonological disorder in comparison with that in typically developing controls.<br /><strong>Study Design:</strong> Case-control study.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> A total of 23 children with phonological disorder (aged 5-10 years) and 21 age- and sex-matched controls (P &gt; 0.05) participated in the study. Participants had pure-tone thresholds &le; 15 dB hearing loss and normal middle ear functions. Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions with and without contralateral acoustic stimulation were measured.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> Although the mean transient evoked otoacoustic emissions suppressions were lower in the group with phonological disorder than in the controls, these differences were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). No left/right ear asymmetry of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions suppression was detected in either of the groups (P &gt; 0.05).<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Children with phonological disorder did not show alterations in medial olivocochlear functioning in the medial olivocochlear activity as measured by the contralateral suppression of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions.</p>												        					</div>
