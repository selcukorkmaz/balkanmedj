	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We aimed to investigate the predicting performances of Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II and Mortality Probability Model (MPM) II0 and MPM II24 on determining the mortality rates of intensive care unit (ICU) patients.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Consecutive 100 patients admitted to the ICU were investigated retrospectively, and 92 of them were included in the study. Initial SAPS and MPM analysis and calculations for mortality prediction percentages were performed with auxiliary software package. Transfer data, total ICU and hospital stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were calculated.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: Most of the patients (53%) were transferred to the ICU from the emergency department. Twenty two patients were transferred to another department and 15 patients were discharged. The number of patients died were 50, the mortality rate was determined as 54%. The ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation of patients who died were found as statistically significant (p=0.007, p=&lt;0.0001, respectively).</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although SAPS II, MPM II0 and MPM II24 analysis are related to mortality, they have no effect on predicting the mortality independent from logistic regression analysis. The predicted mortality rates were found related with those determined by logistic regression analysis. Duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay and mechanical ventilation duration above 24 hours affect the predicted mortality, independently<strong>.</strong></span></p>
