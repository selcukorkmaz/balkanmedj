Acne can severely affect social and psychological functioning. Patients with acne may have anxiety, depression, decreased self-esteem, interpersonal difficulties, unemployment, social withdrawal, and even suicidal intent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of this study was to evaluate the temperament and character inventory (TCI) of patients with acne and to compare the results with those of healthy controls.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case-control study</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: The study population consisted of 47 patients with acne, and 40 healthy control subjects. All participants were instructed to complete a self-administered 240-item TCI and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: In this study, the scores for the temperament properties Worry and pessimism (HA1) and Dependence (RD4) and the character properties Social acceptance (C1) and Integrated conscience (C5) were found to be higher in acne patients than in healthy controls (p&lt;0.05). Compared to the controls, depression and anxiety scores were found to be markedly higher in the patients with acne. Acne type correlated positively with the Disorderliness (NS4) subscale of Novelty seeking (NS) and anxiety. Additionally, acne type correlated negatively with the Attachment (RD3) subscale of Reward Dependence (RD), with the Transpersonal identification (ST2) and Spiritual acceptance (ST3) subscales of Self-Trancendence (ST), and with the Compassion (C4) subscale of Cooperativeness (C).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Studies in this area may lead to the development of specific and focused interventions for TCI in patients with acne vulgaris. We suggest that the evaluation and treatment of acne should also include psychosomatic approaches in clinical practice.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
