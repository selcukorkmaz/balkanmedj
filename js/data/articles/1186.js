While 11 patients (8 males, 3 females; mean age 56.6&plusmn;11.9) were treated surgically, 11 patients (10 males, 1 female; mean age 72.8&plusmn;7.7) were followed up by medical therapy. Patients operated and patients followed up with medical treatment were called and evaluated for pain history, physical examination signs, and thoracoabdominal computed tomography with 6-month intervals.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Of surgically treated patients, two had acute descending aortic rupture, nine had acute type III dissection unresponsive to medical therapy. Seven patients died (63.6%). Comorbid diseases, excessive bleeding during the operation and blood transfusion, cross clamp time and development of low cardiac output were found to be the causes of high mortality. Although early results in surgical group were poor, late results in surgical and medical groups were similar. In the follow-up (6-28 months) of medically treated patients distal organ ischemia or aortic diameter increase were seen, there were no complications or mortality.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Type III dissection is a disease with high mortality and morbidity. Patients&#39; response to medical therapy were found to be good.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
