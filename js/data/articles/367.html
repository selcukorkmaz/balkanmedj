	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent in the adult population worldwide. Education may play an important role in preventing metabolic syndrome in young adults, especially those who are attending university. Such adults are at a critical point in their lives and make their own lifestyle choices that can affect their future health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The aims of this study were to determine the metabolic syndrome risk levels of students from the Faculty of Health Sciences.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Survey design study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: In a questionnaire developed by the researchers to collect data in accordance with the relevant literature, the scale of the risk of metabolic syndrome was assessed. A stepwise logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Important risk factors for metabolic syndrome were found to be gender, weight gain, &ldquo;stress eating&rdquo; excessive amounts of food, sleeping for more than 8 hours a day, feeling tired after sleep, belonging to a divided family, and eating whilst working on the computer.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The students from the Faculty of Health Sciences, particularly because they are trained in the health sector, are expected to have more information about the risk factors of metabolic syndrome, and take necessary precautions to prevent it.</p>
