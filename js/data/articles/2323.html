												        						<p><strong>Background: </strong>Nanomedicine has provided promising tools for the&nbsp;imaging, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. Gold nanoparticles&nbsp;(GNPs) may be useful in enhancing the efficacy of radiotherapy, such&nbsp;as radiosensitization, in cancer therapy.<strong><br /></strong><strong>Aims</strong>: To develop a nanodrug complex containing cetuximab (C225,CTX) and cisplatin (CDDP) conjugated with GNPs and to investigate&nbsp;its cytotoxic effects on oral cavity cancer cells when combined with&nbsp;radiotherapy.<br /><strong>Study Design</strong>: In vitro cell culture study.<br /><strong>Methods</strong>: The GNPs were synthesized and successfully conjugated with cetuximab and cisplatin. Cell viability was monitored by the&nbsp;xCELLigence real-time cell analysis (RTCA) single-plate (SP) system&nbsp;in GNP-treated UPCI-SCC-131 cells for 48 hours. Cells with/without&nbsp;GNPs were irradiated with 6 MV X-rays, and colony formation was&nbsp;assayed to investigate the long-term effects of GNPs and the nanodrug&nbsp;complex after irradiation on radiotherapy-resistant oral cavity cancer&nbsp;cells.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: The GNPs entered the tumor cells, and GNP&ndash;CDDP (P &lt;.0001) and GNP&ndash;CDDP&ndash;CTX (P &lt; .0001) were shown to cause a&nbsp;decrease in cell viability. GNP and GNP&ndash;CTX combined with radiotherapy&nbsp;led to greater reduction on UPCI-SCC-131 colony numbers,&nbsp;than radiation alone (P = .0369) and radiation with free CTX, with sensitizing&nbsp;enhancement ratios of 1 : 2 and 1 : 9, respectively.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The cetuximab and cisplatin-conjugated gold nanodrug complex has a great potential to increase cytotoxicity and overcome&nbsp;resistance to radiotherapy, in the treatment of oral cavity cancer.</p>												        					</div>
