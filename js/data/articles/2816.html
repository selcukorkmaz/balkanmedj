<h3>To the Editor,</h3>
<p>We read with considerable interest the article by Uzun and Elkiran<sup>1</sup> describing the application of the YOLOv11 deep learning model for the automated diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) from transvaginal ultrasonography images. The authors demonstrated impressive diagnostic performance, with the model achieving a mean average precision (mAP) exceeding 0.90 for the detection and classification of ovarian follicles. We congratulate the authors on this methodologically rigorous study and wish to offer several observations regarding clinical integration and potential avenues for further development.</p>
<p>First, the selection of YOLOv11 as the object detection framework is noteworthy, as it represents a significant advancement over prior YOLO iterations in terms of both accuracy and inference speed.<sup>2</sup> The real-time processing capability of YOLOv11 is particularly relevant for clinical deployment, where diagnostic decisions must be rendered during the ultrasonographic examination. However, the training and validation datasets in this study were derived from a single institutional source, which raises concerns about the generalizability of the model. Ultrasonographic image quality and acquisition protocols vary substantially across institutions depending on equipment manufacturer, transducer frequency, operator technique, and patient body habitus.<sup>3</sup> Multi-center validation studies incorporating images from diverse clinical settings and ultrasound platforms are essential to establish the external validity of the model before clinical implementation.</p>
<p>Second, while the automated follicle detection and counting capabilities of the model are impressive, the diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam criteria requires integration of ultrasonographic findings with clinical (oligo-anovulation, hyperandrogenism) and biochemical (serum androgen levels) parameters.<sup>4</sup> A standalone imaging-based diagnostic model, however accurate in follicle detection, cannot capture the full diagnostic complexity of PCOS. Future iterations of the model could incorporate a multimodal architecture that integrates clinical and laboratory data alongside ultrasonographic features to provide a comprehensive diagnostic assessment.</p>
<p>Third, we would like to raise the issue of real-time deployment infrastructure. Deep learning models with high computational demands may not be readily deployable on the hardware configurations available in typical clinical ultrasound suites, particularly in resource-limited settings.<sup>5</sup> The authors should consider reporting the model's computational requirements, including graphics processing unit (GPU) memory utilization and inference time per image, to facilitate assessment of deployment feasibility. Additionally, model compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation may be employed to reduce computational overhead without substantial performance degradation.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>Finally, the clinical adoption of AI-based diagnostic tools requires regulatory approval, integration with existing picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), and physician training on the interpretation and limitations of AI-generated outputs.<sup>7</sup> Prospective clinical studies comparing AI-assisted diagnosis with conventional physician-only assessment in terms of diagnostic accuracy, time efficiency, and inter-observer variability will be critical to demonstrate the added clinical value of this promising technology.</p>
