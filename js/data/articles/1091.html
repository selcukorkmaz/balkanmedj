	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	It is estimated that pituitary tumors account for 10% to 15% of all primary brain tumors. Patients with pituitary adenoma and cranial nerve involvement should be evaluated regarding possible oculomotor nerve infiltration. We present this case to emphasize the importance of diagnosing infiltration to the oculomotor nerve in patients with pituitary adenoma. Evacuation of the tumor can be beneficial to decrease the level of hormone secreted and its clinical consequences, and also for the recovery of oculomotor nerve function in cases with pressure effect on the oculomotor nerve, but it is not effective for such recovery in cases with direct infiltration to the nerve by the tumor as in the present case.</p>
