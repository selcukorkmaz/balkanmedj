	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Background</strong>: Melanocytic nevus is a rare occurrence in the tarsal conjunctiva and only 7 well-described cases have been reported previously in the English literature.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: The medical records of 4 patients with tarsal conjunctival melanocytic nevus were reviewed, together with the relevant literature. All patients (3 women and 1 man; age range: 17 - 40 years) had been referred with a suspicion of melanoma. There was one tarsal nevus in the lower eyelid in 3 patients and 2 nevi in the upper eyelid in 1 patient. All lesions were darkly pigmented with irregular borders and were associated with a history of a recent growth in size. An intralesional cyst was present in 1 nevus only. After surgical excision, no recurrence or complication occurred during the follow-up period (range: 7 - 48 months).</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Conclusion:</strong>&nbsp;Tarsal melanocytic nevus has been described in detail in 11 cases, including these 4 cases, in the English literature. The lesion arose from the lower eyelid in all cases except one. Tarsal melanocytic nevi may frequently display clinical features suggesting melanoma, such as advanced patient age, recent growth, dark and irregular pigmentation, nodularity, hypervascularity, and the absence of an intralesional cyst. After total excision, nevus recurrence or malignant trans-formation has not been reported.</p>
