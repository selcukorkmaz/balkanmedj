	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: To evaluate the efficacy of single dose intramuscular methotrexate in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: 32 patients who matched the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Success of treatment was defined as a resolution of ectopic pregnancy without performing surgical intervention. The cases in whom the treatment was successful and those that were not were compared for &beta;-hCG values and clinical features.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: &beta;-hCG at diagnosis averaged 1293.9 mIU/ml. Of the 32 patients who received methotrexate, 26 were successfully treated. 23 patients (71.8%) received a single dose of methotrexate, 3 patients (9.3%) received an additional dose of methotrexate, 6 patients (18.7%) who had failed methotrexate required surgery for cure. The success rate of single-dose methotrexate was 79.3%.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our study shows that single dose systemic methotrexate treatment can be used as an option in unruptured pregnancies.</p>
