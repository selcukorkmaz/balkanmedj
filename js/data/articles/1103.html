	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Sepsis in critical illness is associated with the progressive failure of multiple organs. Additional biomarkers in severe sepsis are needed to tackle the challenges of determining a prognosis and optimizing the selection of high-risk patients for therapy. This paper evaluates serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and amylase as prognostic factors for survival in patients with severe sepsis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Ninety-five patients (42 males, 53 females) meeting the criteria for severe sepsis were chosen for the study. APACHE II scores, serum levels of CRP and amylase were taken on admission to an intensive care unit, two days later, and on the day of discharge from the intensive care unit or on the day of death.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Amylase levels, median CRP levels, and APACHE II scores were significantly higher in the non-survivors than in the surviving patients.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Serum amylase and CRP are predictors of survival in patients with severe sepsis. High amylase and CRP levels appear to be a valuable tool for individual risk assessment in severe sepsis patients and for stratification of high-risk patients in future intervention trials.</p>
