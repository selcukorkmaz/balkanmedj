												        						<p><strong>Background</strong>: Cystic fibrosis, a pulmonary disease which is an autosomal&nbsp;recessive, inherited, multisystemic genetic disease commonly seen&nbsp;in the Caucasian race, is the most frequent cause of mortality and morbidity.&nbsp;So far, more than 2000 disease-causing gene variants have been&nbsp;found and this number has been increasing with the studies conducted.&nbsp;Although there is not yet enough data that include the Turkish population,&nbsp;the recent increase of studies is noteworthy.<br /><strong>Aims</strong>: To discover the genetic variation in patients diagnosed with cystic&nbsp;fibrosis in the Central Anatolian region.<br /><strong>Study Design</strong>: Cross-sectional study.<br /><strong>Methods</strong>: The study was carried out in the Central Anatolian region in&nbsp;3 pediatric pulmonology departments (Kayseri, Konya, and Ankara) in&nbsp;Turkey between July 2014 and December 2017. The Sanger and Next&nbsp;Generation Sequence analyses were used for exon and exon&ndash;intron&nbsp;boundaries in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatory&nbsp;(CFTR) gene, and in selected patients, mutation analysis was&nbsp;performed using the Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification&nbsp;technique for large deletions and duplications.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: CFTR gene analysis was performed for 316 patients and&nbsp;215 of them were genetically diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. Sixtythree<br />different variants were defined in these patients and 7 of these&nbsp;were large deletions/duplications detected with the MLPA method. The&nbsp;most frequent variants were F508del (29.6%), G85E (8.2%), N1303K&nbsp;(8.2%), Y515* (7.5%), and G542* (3.4%).<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Using sequencing and Multiplex Ligation-dependent&nbsp;Probe Amplification methods, the identification of seven new mutations&nbsp;that were not previously reported in the literature contributes to a better&nbsp;understanding of the heterogeneous nature of CFTR mutations in the&nbsp;Turkish population. When no mutations are detected (pathogenic/probably&nbsp;pathogenic) in clinically compatible cases, Multiplex Ligationdependent&nbsp;Probe Amplification analysis contributes significantly to the&nbsp;diagnosis.</p>												        					</div>
