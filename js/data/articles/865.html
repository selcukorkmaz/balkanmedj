	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Protracted febrile myalgia (PFM) is a rare form of vasculitic disease which is an uncommon dramatic manifestation of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), characterized by severe crippling myalgia and high fever. We describe a 14-year-old boy who presented with fever, abdominal pain and severe myalgia in all his muscles for 5 days. The diagnosis of PFM was considered based on the presence of fever, paralyzing myalgia with normal CPK, elevated CRP and ESR. Thus, we started prednisolone treatment and his symptoms disappeared and acute-phase reactants declined rapidly. Mutational analysis of the MEFV gene demonstrated homozygote M694V mutation. Thus, he was diagnosed as PFM and FMF. In this report, we present a child with PFM as the sole feature preceding the diagnosis of FMF, and draw attention to the PFM for the diagnosis of FMF even the patient does not fulfill the criteria for the clinical diagnosis.</p>
