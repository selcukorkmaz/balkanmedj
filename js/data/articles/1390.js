Immunohistochemical markers and stains, namely bcl-2, an antiapopitotic marker, and Ki-67, a proliferative marker were applied to the sections of selected diagnostic tissue blocks. Additionally, mitotic counts per 10 high power fields were obtained in cases of hyperplasia and carcinoma.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Mean H-score value for bcl-2 reaction was 0.48 for endometrioid carcinoma. Mean H-score values for cases of hyperplasia, disordered proliferation, proliferation and atrophy were calculated as 1.93, 1.62, 1.5 and 1.0, respectively. Ki-67 proliferation index for endometrioid carcinoma was 48.9%. This index was 32%, 29%, 31.5% and 8.4% for hyperplasia, disordered proliferation, proliferation and atrophy, respectively.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Staining with bcl&ndash;2 peaked in cases of hyperplasia, and lost its intensity as nuclear atypia became evident. Weakest staining was observed in cases with grade II and III endometrioid carcinomas. In contrast, proliferative indexes increased with increasing grades of carcinoma.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
