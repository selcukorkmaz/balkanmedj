	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Carvedilol therapy reduces the severity of the ventricular dysfunction, increases left ventricular ejection fraction and reduces the mortality and morbidity. However, the effect of carvedilol on P-wave dispersion and P-wave duration in patients with systolic heart failure is unknown. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of carvedilol therapy on P-wave duration and P-wave dispersion in patients with heart failure.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: Fifty-six patients with heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% were prospectively included in the study. Carvedilol was administered in addition to standard therapy for heart failure. Clinical examination and radionuclide study and baseline maximum and minimum P-wave duration and P-wave dispersion measurements were performed for each patient at the beginning and at the end of the fourth month of carvedilol therapy.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Maximum P-wave duration and P-wave dispersion significantly decreased, left ventricular ejection fraction and NYHA functional class improved by carvedilol therapy (Maximum P-wave duration; from 126&plusmn;9 ms to 120&plusmn;7ms; p=0.001, P-wave dispersion; from 51&plusmn;7 ms to 46&plusmn;5 ms; p=0.001).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Carvedilol therapy directly or indirectly reduces maximum P-wave duration and P-wave dispersion. This may lead to a reduction in the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure.</p>
