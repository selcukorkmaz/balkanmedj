The purpose of our study was to compare the efficacy of axillary brachial plexus block using an ultrasound technique with peripheral nerve stimulation technique.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: Sixty patients for whom elective forearm and hand surgery was planned were included in the study. Group 1 (n=30) was given an axillary block by using ultrasonography, Group 2 (n=30) was given axillary block by using a peripheral nerve stimulator. The quality and time of onset of the sensorial and motor blockade were assessed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The average time needed to perform the axillary brachial plexus block was similar in both groups. Although not significant statistically, it was observed that the sensory block was achieved earlier in Group 1. However, the degree of motor blockade was more intense in Group 1 than in Group 2.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block is a preferable method with faster onset time and better quality of motor blockade compared to the PNS technique.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
