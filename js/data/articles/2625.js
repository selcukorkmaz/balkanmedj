However, both Zn deficiency and excess can cause oxidative stress and neurodegenerative diseases. As previously reported, immunoglobulin G (IgG) can modulate oxidative stress in various disorders.<br /><strong>Aims:</strong> To investigate whether IgG treatment can alleviate oxidative stress caused by Zn<sup>0</sup> on microglia in vitro.<br /><strong>Study Design:</strong> In vitro study.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> The feasibility of Zn<sup>0</sup> treatment was evaluated using the MTS assay. Oxidative stress following treatment with Zn<sup>0</sup>, either alone or with IgG supplementation, was determined with dihydrorhodamine 123 staining. Flow cytometry was employed to ascertain the intracellular protein levels of TRIM21, PINK, PARKIN, MFN2, Beclin-1, and active LC3B.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> In silico screening confirmed the association between Zn<sup>0</sup> cytotoxicity and apoptosis. Furthermore, oxidative stress was identified as a critical mechanism that underlies Zn<sup>0</sup> neurotoxicity. The in silico analysis revealed that Zn can interact with the constant region of the Ig heavy chain, suggesting a potential role for IgG in alleviating Zn<sup>0</sup>-induced cytotoxicity. Experimental findings supported this hypothesis, as IgG administration significantly reduced Zn<sup>0</sup>-induced mitochondrial stress in a dose-dependent manner. The upregulation of PINK1 levels by Zn<sup>0</sup> exposure suggests that mitochondrial injury promotes mitophagy. Interestingly, Zn<sup>0</sup> decreased TRIM21 levels, which is reversed by IgG administration.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> These findings elucidate the cellular responses to Zn<sup>0</sup> and highlight the potential use of intravenous immunoglobulin in mitigating the adverse effects of acute Zn<sup>0</sup> exposure.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#methods\">Methods</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#results\">Results</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#discussion\">Discussion</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"introduction\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Introduction</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<hr size=\"1\" color=\"#f2f2f2\">\r\n<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>\r\n<p>Zinc (Zn) is the second most abundant trace element in the human body, following iron, and is essential for numerous biological processes.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>It serves as a cofactor for over 300 enzymes and is involved in the structural and regulatory functions of many proteins and DNA-binding transcription factors.<sup>2</sup> However, excess Zn can induce apoptosis and cause copper deficiency, which has been associated with various negative consequences, including the production of copper-dependent antioxidant enzymes.<sup>3</sup> In neural tissues, Zn imbalance can lead to impaired brain development and cognitive dysfunction, memory deficits and impaired learning ability, excitotoxic damage and death of postsynaptic neurons following traumatic brain injury, ischemia, and seizures. In addition, Zn imbalance is connected with an increased risk for depression and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease.<sup>1</sup> Increased Zn levels in response to brain ischemia is proven to induce polarization of microglia to the proinflammatory M1 phenotype, which may result in deficiencies in object recognition memory.<sup>4</sup></p>\r\n<p>Zn exerts neurotoxicity by reducing mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels.<sup>5</sup> Mitochondrial dysfunction results from increased ROS production along with decreased antioxidant activity, which in turn promotes further ROS production and leads to inflammation.<sup>6</sup> Thus, eliminating dysfunctional mitochondria is crucial for maintaining cellular viability. This is mainly achieved through mitophagy, a complex process that occurs through autophagy to eliminate damaged mitochondria.<sup>7</sup> One of the extensively studied stress-induced mitophagy pathways relies on the coordinated actions of key proteins, including Parkin, mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1).<sup>8,9</sup> When mitochondrial damage occurs, PINK1 accumulates on the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it phosphorylates both ubiquitin and MFN2. This enables the autophagic machinery to recognize mitochondrial proteins by ubiquitinating them through the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Parkin.<sup>10</sup> The degradation of damaged mitochondria results from an interaction between ubiquitin on mitochondria and autophagy receptors, which is crucial for the maintenance of mitochondrial quality control. This process is essential for cellular homeostasis and the overall health of the organism. If mediated autophagy is impaired, cells can still participate in macroautophagy, which entails engulfing mitochondria and other cell organelles to form autophagosomes, which subsequently fuse with lysosomes for degradation.<sup>11</sup> Dysfunctions in mitophagy have been reported in older adults as well as those with age-related disorders.<sup>7</sup></p>\r\n<p>Previous studies have suggested that immunoglobulin G (IgG) administration can modulate oxidative stress in various diseases.<sup>12,13</sup> However, there is a lack of research examining the effect of IgG treatment on Zn-induced oxidative stress. The involvement of tripartite motif 21 (TRIM21), an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that takes part in intracellular IgG clearance, has been demonstrated to be involved in autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.<sup>14-16</sup> Hence, this study aimed to investigate whether IgG treatment can alleviate Zn-mediated oxidative stress in microglia in vitro and whether mitophagy plays a role in this protective effect.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a><a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#methods\">Methods</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#results\">Results</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#discussion\">Discussion</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"methods\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Methods</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>METHODS</h3>\r\n<p><strong><em>In silico screening</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>The main biological processes associated with neurodegenerative diseases, their relationship with Zn exposure, and the potential molecular functions implicated in neuroinflammatory responses were determined using the genetic data extracted from (Comparative Toxicogenomics Database; http://CTD.mdibl.org).

At 48 hours (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2625_1.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 2c</b></a>) and 72 hours (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2625_1.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 2d</b></a>), the lowest doses of Zn<sup>0 </sup>that significantly decreased the viability of HMC3 cells were determined to be 1 &micro;g/ml (<em>p</em> = 0.0039) and 0.05 &micro;g/ml Zn<sup>0</sup> (<em>p</em> = 0.001), respectively. To conduct additional evaluations, the lowest concentration that significantly reduced cellular viability for the respective time point was employed.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Evaluation of mitochondrial ROS accumulation</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>As revealed by the DHR123 assay, Zn<sup>0 </sup>did not lead to ROS accumulation in HMC3 cells after 12 h (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2625_2.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 3a</b></a>). However, the increased DHR123 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) at 24 hours suggests that Zn<sup>0 </sup>induced mitochondrial stress was observed at this time point (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.0001) (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2625_2.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 3b</b></a>) Representative histogram plots regarding the DHR123 assay are presented in <a href=\"https://balkanmedicaljournal.org/uploads/pdf/Supplementary-Figures.pdf\">Supplementary Figure 7</a>. Moreover, IgG administration at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 100 &micro;g/ml in conjunction with Zn<sup>0 </sup>treatment significantly decreased DHR123 MFI (<em>p </em>&lt; 0.05) after 24 hours of incubation (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.0001 for 6.25 and 25 &micro;g/ml; <em>p</em> = 0.0004 for 100 &micro;g/ml; <em>p</em> = 0.023 for 50 &micro;g/ml; and <em>p</em> = 0.027 for 12.5 &micro;g/ml), revealing that IgG administration can suppress ROS accumulation. Since ROS accumulation was observed after 24 hours of Zn<sup>0</sup> exposure, evaluations regarding the proteins implicated in mitophagy and macrophagy were evaluated at this time point. However, ROS accumulation was not observed when the cells were incubated either with Zn<sup>0</sup> or IgG along with Zn<sup>0</sup> for more than 24 hours (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2625_2.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 3c-d</b></a>).

In cultured mouse cortical neurons, Zn reduced cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, leading to a progressive decrease in ATP levels and subsequent cell death, suggesting a potential inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes.<sup>28-30</sup> Studies on hepatic mitochondria have shown that Zn inhibits several mitochondrial enzymes, including &alpha;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, NAD+ -dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c oxidase.<sup>31,32</sup> In rat neurons, Zn upregulates the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase pathway), leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cell death.<sup>33</sup> Numerous studies demonstrate the interconnection between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the pathology of chronic neurodegeneration in various neurological diseases.<sup>34</sup> Moreover, mitochondria play a role in coordinating innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as managing oxidative stress. Therefore, they form a link between neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes.<sup>35,36</sup></p>\r\n<p>Dysregulation of apoptosis has been documented in many neurodegenerative disorders.<sup>23</sup> The in silico evaluations presented in our study also confirmed that the cytotoxic effect of Zn<sup>0 </sup>is linked with apoptosis. A multifaceted role in the initiation and inhibition of apoptosis has been demonstrated for both intracellular and extracellular Zn homeostasis.<sup>23</sup> Zn acts as an inhibitor of the procaspases, including proenzymes of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9.<sup>37</sup> Moreover, at low concentrations, Zn<sup>0</sup> promotes neuroglial cell proliferation,<sup>38</sup> which is consistent with our findings indicating microglial proliferation occurred after 24 hours of incubation at low doses, whereas higher doses led to decreased viability. Overall, our findings suggested that Zn<sup>0</sup> exerted cytotoxicity in microglia in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner.</p>\r\n<p>Oxidative stress is highlighted as one of the key mechanisms that affect the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.<sup>39</sup> In our study, the in silico analysis revealed that oxidative stress is involved in Zn neurotoxicity, which was also confirmed by the DHR123 assay, where Zn significantly increased mitochondrial ROS accumulation after 24 hours, although this effect was not observed at further time points. These data may indicate that Zn<sup>0 </sup>exposure leads to acute mitochondrial stress in vitro, and that the cells may compensate for Zn<sup>0 </sup>induced stress through unknown cellular mechanisms.</p>\r\n<p>In our study, the in silico analysis of the molecular functions implicated in neuroinflammatory diseases revealed that the most significant factors were oxidoreductase activity, as well as IgE and IgG receptor activity and binding. The neuroprotective effect of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) administration is well documented. In a murine model of experimental stroke, IVIg treatment promoted neuroprotective responses in microglia, resulting in a decrease in lesion size.<sup>12</sup> In a murine in vivo epilepsy model, the administration of IVIg pre- and post-treatment attenuated acute inflammation by reducing local glial activation and complement system activation. Moreover, the authors revealed that IVIg administration altered the expression and function of IgG-specific receptors (Fc&gamma;R, Fc-gamma receptors) and blocked the complement receptors on mononuclear phagocytic cells.<sup>40 </sup>However, none of these studies were performed using Zn<sup>0</sup>. In this study, the direct chemical-protein interaction analysis demonstrated that Zn can interact with the constant region of the Ig heavy chain, supporting the hypothesis that IgG can alleviate Zn<sup>0</sup>-induced cytotoxicity. However, additional studies are required to clarify the binding between Zn ions and the F(c) fragments of human IgGs, in addition to elucidating the mechanism by which Zn ions are taken up into cells through the Zn-IgG complex.<sup>26</sup> Some of the factors that should be considered in a more thorough examination of the IgG binding capacity are the various binding sites on the different antibody fragments, the degree of antibody glycosylation, the structural change in F(c) upon binding, and the flexibility of the loop structures.<sup>41</sup> Consistent with the in silico findings, IgG administration ranging in concentrations between 6.25 and 100 &micro;g/ml significantly decreased Zn<sup>0</sup>-induced mitochondrial stress. Given that the exact mechanism of Zn binding via human IgG is not yet fully understood,<sup>26</sup> this study&rsquo;s significant finding is that mitochondrial ROS accumulation may not depend on IgG concentration.</p>\r\n<p>The association between exposure to Zn<sup>O</sup> nanoparticles and mitochondrial damage has been well documented. However, the studies investigating its effects on the mitochondrial quality control processes in the central nervous system are rather limited. Recently, Wang et al.<sup>42 </sup>revealed that Zn<sup>O</sup> nanoparticles promoted mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. In this study, mitochondrial biogenesis regulator peroxisome PGC-1 (proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) and fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) were found to be upregulated. Zn<sup>O</sup> also promotes autophagic flux, as well as PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Similarly, in another study performed on the murine microglia cell line BV-2, Zn<sup>O</sup> was found to promote Parkin-mediated mitophagy, while the genetic ablation of PINK1 resulted in mitophagy failure, eventually leading to cell death.<sup>43</sup> In the context of hypoxia/reoxygenation, Bian et al.<sup>44</sup> examined the impact of ZnCl exposure on the cardiac cell line H9c2. They found that ZnCl induces mitophagy through an interaction with PINK1 and Beclin-1.<sup>44</sup> In this study, Zn<sup>0 </sup>significantly upregulated PINK1 levels, which is consistent with these findings. Conversely, we found that the increase in active LC3B and Beclin-1 levels following Zn<sup>0 </sup>exposure was not significant, which suggests that higher doses of Zn<sup>0 </sup>may be required for the lysosomal degradation of the damaged mitochondria in microglia. Interestingly, Zn<sup>0 </sup>exposure led to a substantial decrease in TRIM21, a protein that is involved in the proteasomal degradation of antibodies.<sup>45</sup> Given that TRIM21 is involved in the clearance of the pathogens bound to IgG, this finding suggests that Zn<sup>0 </sup>may lead to an impairment of proteasomal degradation of cytosolic pathogens via downregulating TRIM21, which in turn may impair innate immune responses. Furthermore, IgG administration to all groups that were also exposed to Zn<sup>0 </sup>resulted in a dose-dependent upregulation of TRIM21 in comparison to both control and sole Zn<sup>0 </sup>groups, suggesting that IgG internalization and subsequent degradation occurred. Concomitant with the increase in TRIM21 levels, IgG administration led to a significant decrease in PINK1 levels, indicating that mitochondrial damage was alleviated. However, IgG administration at high doses has been shown to increase Parkin levels, although Parkin acts as a downstream target of PINK1 and cannot promote mitophagy in the absence/decrease of PINK1.<sup>45</sup></p>\r\n<p>The results of this study confirmed that Zn<sup>0 </sup>induced cytotoxicity in the human microglia cell line HMC3 by promoting oxidative stress. However, this effect was only observed for a brief period, indicating that microglia are capable of tolerating Zn<sup>0</sup>-induced mitochondrial stress to a limited extent. Further investigations revealed that Zn<sup>0</sup>-induced mitochondrial damage enhanced the mitophagy response by increasing PINK1 expression. However, in the presence of Zn<sup>0</sup>, IgG administration protected cells against mitochondrial stress and hampered mitophagy, which may be attributed to its direct interaction via Zn. This conclusion is based on in silico evaluations and requires confirmation through in vitro studies.</p>\r\n<p>A significant limitation of our study is that it is focused on the effects of Zn<sup>0</sup> but not the mechanistic effect of IgG alone, which may be investigated in further studies. In addition, the effect of receptor-mediated mitophagy, which involves FUNDC1, NIX/BNIP3L, and BNIP3, may be investigated along with the PINK1/PARKIN axis when evaluating the protective properties of IgG treatment on Zn<sup>0 </sup>toxicity.<sup>46</sup> Moreover, for clarifying the impact of IgG on Zn-induced mitochondrial damage and mitophagy, Zn isotopes or labeled Zn may be used.<sup>47,48</sup></p>\r\n<p>Although it is well established that oxidative effects are induced by Zn<sup>O</sup> or ZnCl at extremely high and low levels,<sup>49</sup> Zn<sup>0 </sup>induced cellular responses remain unclear. Our study is the first to demonstrate that Zn<sup>0 </sup>exposure leads to cytotoxicity in microglia in vitro and may induce mitochondrial stress. Moreover, IgG administration along with Zn<sup>0</sup>-exposed cells protected them against mitochondrial damage, suggesting that IVIg may be used in cases with high levels of acute Zn exposure. This study provides novel insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying Zn<sup>0 </sup>neurotoxicity and proposes a new approach for therapeutic intervention with IgG in neuroinflammatory conditions associated with Zn dysregulation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements:</strong> We thank Dr. &Uuml;mran Aydemir Sezer for providing the zero-valent zinc and to Dr. Andrej Korenić for his assistance with the design of <a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2625_0.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 1</b></a>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ethics Committee Approval:</strong> This study is an in vitro study which involves a commercial cell line.
