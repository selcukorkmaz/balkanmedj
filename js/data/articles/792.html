	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: In this study, the presence of Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) was investigated in the Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolates by PCR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: In this study, 130 MRSA and 20 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were tested among various clinical samples between February 2006 and June 2008. Confi rmation of S. aureus isolates and the methicillin resistance of these isolates were made by multiplex PCR. The presence of PVL was tested by both multiplex PCR and single target PCR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The presence of PVL was determined in 3 isolates. Two of the isolates were from MRSA isolates, one was from MSSA isolates. One of the PVL positive MRSA isolate was recovered from a wound specimen, the other was from blood culture. PVL positive MSSA isolate was recovered from an urine specimen. All of the three PVL positive isolates were resistant to tetracycline. One of the PVL positive MRSA isolates which was recovered from blood culture was resistant to gentamicin and ciprofl oxacin, while the other PVL positive isolate was susceptible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Further studies are needed to determine the prevalence and genetic characteristics of PVL positive isolates and to prevent dissemination of PVL positive isolates both in the hospital environment and the community.</p>
