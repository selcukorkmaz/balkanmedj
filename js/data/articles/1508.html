	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We investigated blood erythrocyte arginase activity in lung cancer patients and the effect of cell type and extrapulmonary metastasis on this activity.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: The study included 46 lung cancer patients (mean age 63.1 years) and 29 healthy subjects (mean age 57.2 years). Erythrocyte arginase activity was determined with the use of the Geyer-Dabich method. Erythrocyte arginase activity was compared between patients with small cell lung cancer (n=15), non-small cell lung cancer (n=31), extrapulmonary metastases (n=23), and no metastasis (n=23).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Compared to healthy controls, erythrocyte arginase activity was significantly increased in all lung cancer patients (p&lt;0.01), and in patient groups with small cell lung cancer (p&lt;0.05), non-small cell lung cancer (p&lt;0.01), extrapulmonary metastases (p&lt;0.01), and no metastasis (p&lt;0.01). On the other hand, erythrocyte arginase activity did not differ significantly between patients with small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, and between patients with and without extrapulmonary metastases.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our data suggest that, compared to healthy subjects, erythrocyte arginase activity is significantly increased in lung cancer patients, with no additional effect of cell type or extrapulmonary metastases.</p>
