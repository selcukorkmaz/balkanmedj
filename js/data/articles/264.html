	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Definitive radiotherapy plays a major role in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA NSCLC). After the impact of RT dose for lung cancer was established, a number of trials were structured with the aim of better local control and overall survival by either dose escalation or shortening the total treatment time through conventional/altered fractionation, even in combination with chemotherapy (CT) and other targeted agents. In spite of the increased number of these studies, the optimal dose or fractionation still remains to be determined. Another aspect questioned is the incorporation of these higher doses and shorter treatment times with chemotherapy or targeted agents. This review summarises the results of significant trials on dose and altered fractionation in the treatment of LA-NSCLC with an emphasis on possible future perspectives.</p>												        					</div>
