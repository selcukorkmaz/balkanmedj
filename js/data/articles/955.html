	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) is an acute febrile, zoonotic disease caused by Rickettsia conorii and endemic infectious disease in Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: In this study, a retrospective examination of 16 cases (4 females, 12 males; mean age 38.9&plusmn;13.0; range 18 to 64 years) that were diagnosed with rickettsioses between 1987-2007 was performed. Diagnosis of MSF was based upon epidemiological and clinical features, indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA), as well as response to doxycycline therapy.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: High fever and maculopapular rash were present in all cases. Palmar and plantar rash were evident in 13 (81.3%) and eschar in eight (50%) cases. All cases responded to treatment within 2&plusmn;0.9 days, and no death was observed.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Mediterranean spotted fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients admitting with fever, maculopapular rash, headache and/or musclejoint pain during spring, summer and autumn.</span></p>
