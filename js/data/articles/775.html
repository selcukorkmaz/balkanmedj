<p>
	Castleman&#39;s disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder of unknown aetiology. It has two clinical expressions. The localized form, which usually presents as a slow growing mass and the multicentric form, where tumoural involvement is multilocated. Mediastinal involvement is the most common location of presentation. Parapharyngeal involvement is very rare and, to our knowledge, five pediatric parapharyngeal Castleman&#39;s disease have been reported. We describe the case of a 14-year-old female child who was diagnosed as having parapharyngeal Castleman&#39;s disease.</p>
