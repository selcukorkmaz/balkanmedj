	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The characteristic features of exclusively breast-fed infants with hypernatremic dehydration in our neonatal intensive care unit were evaluated.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Within the last two years, fourteen exclusively breast-fed newborn infants (10 females, 4 males; mean gestational age 38&plusmn;1.7; range 34 to 40 weeks) whose serum sodium level was equal to or greater than 150 mEq/L with signs of dehydration were evaluated from clinical charts retrospectively.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: 71% of all cases were girls. Mean birth weight was 3020&plusmn;715 gr. 93% of the cases were AGA and 78.6% were first child of the family. Mean age of mothers was 28&plusmn;5.4 years. 57% of the cases were born by cesarean and 57% were referred to our hospital from different hospitals. The most common presenting complaint was fever and refusing sucking; and mean application time was 5.5&plusmn;4.6 days. On the admission, mean weight loss was 14.5&plusmn;9.1%, serum sodium level 158.5&plusmn;14 mEq/L, serum urea level 73&plusmn;109 mg/dl, serum creatinine level 1.2&plusmn;2.1 mg/dl, and serum osmolarity 338&plusmn;35 mOsmol/L.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It was remarkable that the cases were mostly first babies and born by cesarean section. A possible solution for hypernatremic dehydration would be to provide breast feeding consultancy to mothers.</p>
