	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Seroma is the most common complication after breast surgery. Several methods have been proposed to prevent seroma, but none of these provided a significant effect. A prolonged wound healing process is the most important cause of seroma. Microporous polysaccharide hemospheres (MPH) are used to achieve hemostasis. They may also accelerate wound healing. In this study, the effects of MPH on seroma formation were investigated.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Female Wistar rats weighing between 200 g and 250 g were used. There were eight rats in each of the control and study groups. Right breast mastectomy and axillary dissection were performed in all rats. While no application was performed after the operation in the control group, MPH was locally applied to the surgical site in the study group. Ten days after the operation, seroma fluid was aspirated and the total volume was recorded. The aspirates were analyzed and tissue samples were obtained from the surgical site.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Seroma was significantly lower in the study group (p=0.001). The mean albumin and lactate dehydrogenase levels were significantly lower in the study group (p=0.003). Pathological examination revealed that increase in fibrous tissue was significantly greater in the control group (p=0.032).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: MPH may reduce seroma after mastectomy.</p>
