During the last decade, many of the newer high-dose regimens in different intensity have been developed specifically for patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Today there are three main approaches used prior to allogeneic transplantation: Myeloablative (MA), Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) and Non-MA (NMA) regimens. MA regimens cause irreversible cytopenia and there is a requirement for stem cell support. Patients who receive NMA regimen have minimal cytopenia and this type of regimen can be given without stem cell support. RIC regimens do not fit the criteria of MA and NMA: the cytopenia is reversible and the stem cell support is necessary. NMA/RIC for Allo-HSCT has opened a new era for treating elderly patients and those with comorbidities. The RIC conditioning was used for 40% of all Allo-HSCT and this trend continue to increase. In this paper, we will review these regimens in the setting of especially allogeneic HSCT and our aim is to describe the history, features and impact of these conditioning regimens on specific diseases.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Total Times Cited: 19</strong> (Updated on May. 10 2020 - WoS)</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
