	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins have been implicated in contributing to all stages of tumorigenesis in many cancers, from initiating events to metastatic progression. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association of IRS-2 gene polymorphism with ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: The study group consisted of 185 women: 45 women with ovarian cancer and 140 control subjects. All the patients with ovarian cancer were primarily treated by surgical intervention. Genetic polymorphism of IRS-2 G1057D was detected by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- based restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: For IRS-2 G1057D polymorphism, the frequencies of GG, GD and DD genotypes were 60%, 33.3%, and 6.7%, respectively in the ovarian cancer cases and 53.6%, 38.6% and 7.9 % in controls. The risk for ovarian cancer was not significantlydifferent in the individuals with the IRS-2 DD genotype compared to the GG genotype (95% CI: 0.203-3.04, P: 0.787). Also, there was no association between carriage of the D allele and ovarian cancer risk. We found no significant difference between the genotypes in the ovarian cancer group and control group (P:0.545).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results do not support an association between carriage of the G1057D variant of IRS-2 gene and ovarian cancer.</p>
