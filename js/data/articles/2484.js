A high-fat and high-sugar diet was used to establish a gestational diabetes mellitus model. Mice with gestational diabetes were injected with lentivirus-mediated overexpression of TDAG51. Blood glucose was measured using a glucometer, and glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed to detect insulin resistance. Liver and adipose tissues were subjected to hematoxylin-eosin staining. Cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. Human villous trophoblast cells (HTR-8/SVneo) were treated with a high-glucose medium to induce gestational diabetes mellitus.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> TDAG51 was downregulated in gestational diabetes mellitus and high glucose-induced HTR-8/SVneo. TDAG51 overexpression reduced the level of blood glucose, enhanced serum insulin, and attenuated glucose and insulin tolerance in gestational diabetes mellitus mice. TDAG51 overexpression also ameliorated impaired lipid metabolism and alleviated adipocyte hypertrophy and hepatic lipid droplets in gestational diabetes mellitus mice. The expressions of SREBP-1 and ANGPTL8 were upregulated in gestational diabetes mellitus and showed a negative correlation with TDAG51 in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus. TDAG51 increased the expressions of SREBP-1 and ANGPTL8 in gestational diabetes mellitus mice. TDAG51 overexpression reduced cell apoptosis and enhanced cell viability of high glucose-induced HTR-8/SVneo. Ectopic expression of ANGPTL8 attenuated the TDAG51-induced increase in cell viability and decrease in apoptosis in high glucose-induced HTR-8/SVneo.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> TDAG51 alleviated impaired lipid metabolism and insulin resistance in gestational diabetes mellitus via downregulation of SREBP 1/ANGPTL8 pathway.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#methods\">Methods</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#results\">Results</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#discussion\">Discussion</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"introduction\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Introduction</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<hr size=\"1\" color=\"#f2f2f2\">\r\n<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>\r\n<p>Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 2-5% of normal pregnancies.<sup>1</sup> Dysfunction of pancreatic &beta;-cells in patients with GDM induces insufficient production of insulin and leads to insulin resistance and disturbed metabolism, resulting in an increased risk of metabolic abnormalities, congenital anomalies, macrosomia, hydramnios, preeclampsia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.<sup>2</sup> Therefore, lipid metabolism and glycometabolism alterations and insulin resistance are mainly implicated in the pathogenesis of GDM.<sup>2</sup> Moreover, the offspring of GDM women are susceptible to premature delivery, birth injury, macrosomia, respiratory distress syndrome, and high-glucose tolerance disorder.<sup>3</sup> Current strategies, including insulin treatment, diet, and lifestyle interventions, are widely used for GDM.<sup>4</sup> However, long-term usage of these strategies might affect the developing fetus.<sup>4</sup> Therefore, novel and effective strategies are beneficial for GDM treatment.</p>\r\n<p>T-cell death-associated gene 51 (TDAG51) functions as a transcription factor in various cellular processes.<sup>5</sup> For example, TDAG51 promoted renal interstitial fibrosis and cell apoptosis in mice with chronic kidney disease.<sup>6</sup> TDAG51 exerts a protective effect against depression-like behavior and maternal care defects after parturition.<sup>7</sup> TDAG51 deletion regulated adipogenesis and induced insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and mature obesity.<sup>8</sup> However, TDAG51 overexpression reduced weight gain and improved insulin signaling.<sup>9</sup> TDAG51 was regarded as a potential target for obesity and insulin resistance.<sup>7</sup> TDAG51 was downregulated in the umbilical cord plasma of patients with GDM.<sup>10</sup> However, the role of TDAG51 in GDM remains unclear.</p>\r\n<p>SREBP-1 is a transcription factor that regulates the synthesis of cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids and is involved in innate immunity, cancer, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome.<sup>11,12</sup> Abnormal SREBP-1 expression was associated with the pathogenesis of diabetes.<sup>13</sup> SREBP-1 regulates the expression of genes involved in insulin signaling, such as PI3K, PI3KR3, and insulin receptor substrate 2.<sup>14</sup> The downregulation of SREBP-1 attenuated insulin resistance in mice fed a high-fat diet.<sup>15</sup> The inhibition of SREBP-1 contributed to the amelioration of gestational diabetes.<sup>16</sup> Since the loss of TDAG51 resulted in the upregulation of SREBP-1,<sup>8</sup> TDAG51 might be involved in insulin resistance and lipid metabolism in GDM through SREBP-1.</p>\r\n<p>In this study, the effects of TDAG51 on insulin resistance and lipid metabolism of GDM mice were investigated. The underlying mechanism might provide a promising target for GDM.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a><a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#methods\">Methods</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#results\">Results</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#discussion\">Discussion</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"methods\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Methods</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h3>\r\n<p><strong>Patients&rsquo; Samples</strong></p>\r\n<p>A total of 30 patients with GDM were recruited at Third Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University between 2017 and 2019, and 10 healthy pregnant women were enrolled as control.

The sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide and then blocked in 5% dry milk. Following incubation with primary antibody (anti-TDAG51; 1:50; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), sections were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100; Nuoyang, Beijing, China). Sections were incubated with 3,3&prime;-diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) and measured under a microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Animal Models</strong></p>\r\n<p>A total of 40 male C57BL/6J and 80 female mice were fed with normal laboratory animal feed and kept in standard conditions. The experiment was approved by the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University. The 80 female mice were divided into the control (n = 20) and GDM (n = 60) groups. The control group was fed with normal laboratory animal feed, and the GDM groups were fed with high-fat and high-sugar feed (65% common feed, 10% sugar, 10% yolk, and 15% lard). Eight weeks later, female and male mice (ratio of 2:1) were caged. Vaginal secretions or emboli were examined by microscopy next day, and mice were considered pregnant with an observation of the vaginal embolus or sperm. The gestational day was recorded as GD0. A total of 40 mice were successfully pregnant, with 10 female mice in the control group and 30 in the GDM group. The rest of the mice were abandoned. The lentivirus for TDAG51 overexpression (OE-TDAG51) was acquired from Genechem Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Pregnant mice in the GDM group were divided into three groups: GDM (n = 10), GDM with vector (n = 10), and GDM with OE-TDAG51 (n = 10). The GDM with vector group and the GDM with OE-TDAG51 group were injected with lentivirus via the tail vein at a dose of 1x10<sup>7</sup> U. Levels of blood glucose and serum insulin were detected at GD0, GD10, and GD20. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed at GD15.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Measurement of Blood Glucose and Serum Insulin</strong></p>\r\n<p>Blood samples were obtained from mice in each group via tail venipuncture. A glucometer (Roche Diagnostics, Risch-Rotkreuz, Switzerland) was used to detect blood glucose levels. The serum level of insulin was detected using an ELISA kit (NJJCBIO Co., Ltd, Nanjing, China).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Measurement of Glucose and Insulin Tolerance</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mice were fasted for 6 h before intraperitoneally injected with 2.0 g/kg glucose. Blood glucose concentrations were analyzed by the glucometer at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Mice were also fasted for 1 h before intraperitoneally injected with 1.0 mU/kg insulin for the insulin tolerance test. Blood glucose concentrations were also analyzed using a glucometer at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Measurement of Lipid Metabolism</strong></p>\r\n<p>On GD20, serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) were measured using enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) kits.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hematoxylin-eosin Staining</strong></p>\r\n<p>On GD20, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and liver and adipose tissues were collected. Tissues were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and sliced.

Cells were treated with CCK8 solution (Beyotime, Beijing, China) for 2 h, and absorbance at 450 nm was examined via a Microplate Autoreader (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>\r\n<p><strong>TUNEL Staining</strong></p>\r\n<p>On GD20, the placenta tissues of mice were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and sliced. Sections were then treated with 50 &mu;g/ml proteinase K and incubated in a TdT enzyme working solution of the TUNEL kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotechnology Co. Ltd., Nanjing, China). Sections were then treated with horseradish peroxidase working solution and incubated with 3,3&prime;-diaminobenzidine. Sections were counter-stained by hematoxylin and measured under a microscope. HTR-8/SVneo were also fixed and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton-X. Following incubation with the TdT enzyme working solution, cells were subjected to the same procedures to detect cell apoptosis.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Western Blot</strong></p>\r\n<p>Tissues and cells were lysed to collect the supernatants. Protein samples were segregated and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies: anti-TDAG51 and anti-GAPDH (1:2,000), anti-Bax (1:3,000), anti-cleaved caspase 3 and anti-cleaved PARP (1:4,000), and anti-SREBP-1 and anti-ANGPTL8 (1:5,000).

GDM refers to abnormal glycometabolism during pregnancy, and a high-fat and high-sugar diet decreased serum insulin and increased blood glucose level, leading to insulin resistance.<sup>17</sup> Therefore, high-fat and high-sugar diets were used for animal GDM models.<sup>18</sup> Blood glucose was upregulated, whereas serum insulin was downregulated in GDM mice. Moreover, the glucose and insulin tolerance tests confirmed insulin resistance in GDM mice. TDAG51 was decreased in the placenta samples of GDM mice. TDAG51 loss induces a decrease in glucose disposal, increases plasma-free fatty acids, and stimulates insulin resistance.<sup>8</sup> Our results showed that the overexpression of TDAG51 decreased blood glucose levels and increased serum insulin levels to ameliorate insulin resistance in GDM mice.</p>\r\n<p>Lipid metabolic disorder is a critical regulator of GDM onset.<sup>17</sup> Moreover, patients with GDM showed lower levels of LDL and higher levels of TG, TC, and LDL than women with normal pregnancies.<sup>19</sup> Our study also identified dysregulated lipid metabolism in GDM mice. Furthermore, lipid droplets were accumulated in the liver and adipose tissues of GDM mice. TDAG51 deficiency enhanced lipid accumulation in adipocytes and promoted adiposity with enlarged adipocytes.<sup>8</sup> Our results indicated that the overexpression of TDAG51 enhanced HDL and reduced TG, TC, LDL, and lipid accumulation in GDM mice. SREBP-1 is essential for the synthesis of cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acids, and TDAG51 loss promoted the upregulation of SREBP-1.<sup>8</sup> SREBP-1 was upregulated in GDM, and the overexpression of TDAG51 reduced SREBP-1 expression in GDM mice. Considering that the downregulation of SREBP-1 attenuated insulin resistance in mice fed a high-fat diet,<sup>15</sup> TDAG51 may ameliorate insulin resistance and impaired lipid metabolism in GDM mice through the inhibition of SREBP-1.</p>\r\n<p>ANGPTL8 is expressed in the liver and adipose tissues.<sup>20</sup> ANGPTL8 is involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.<sup>20</sup> The knockdown of ANGPTL8 reduced glucose uptake and ameliorated insulin resistance in HTR-8/SVneo.<sup>21</sup> Moreover, ANGPTL8 was elevated in the plasma of women with GDM,<sup>22</sup> and a high ANGPTL8 expression was considered a predictor of GDM.<sup>23</sup> Our results showed that ANGPTL8 was elevated in GDM and negatively correlated with TDAG51 in patients with GDM. The silencing of SREBP-1 decreased ANGPTL8 expression in HepG2 cells.<sup>24</sup> In this study, the overexpression of TDAG51 reduced ANGPTL8 expression in GDM mice. TDAG51 enhanced cell viability but reduced apoptosis of high glucose-induced HTR-8/SVneo. Furthermore, TDAG51 attenuated the TDAG51-induced increase in cell viability and decrease in apoptosis of high glucose-induced HTR-8/SVneo, revealing that TDAG51 might alleviate GDM through the downregulation of SREBP-1/ANGPTL8.</p>\r\n<p>Collectively, TDAG51 ameliorated insulin resistance and impaired lipid metabolism in GDM mice. TDAG51 reduced SREBP-1 and ANGPTL8 expressions and TDAG51 reduced high glucose-induced cell injury through the downregulation of SREBP1 and ANGPTL8. Therefore, TDAG51/SREBP-1/ANGPTL8 might be a novel target for GDM. However, whether TDAG51 can bind to the promoter of SREBP-1 and regulates the expression should be assessed in future research.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ethics Committee Approval:</strong> All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the standards upheld by the Ethics Committee of Third Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University and with those of the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments for ethical research involving human subjects (approval no: 2016-021).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Written informed consent was obtained from a legally authorized representative(s) for anonymized patient information to be published in this article.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Data Sharing Statement:</strong> The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Authorship Contributions:</strong> Concept- X.W., B.X.; Design- X.W., B.X.; Data Collection or Processing- X.W., B.X.; Analysis or Interpretation- X.W., B.X.; Literature Search- X.W., B.X.; Writing- X.W., B.X.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> No conflict of interest was declared by the authors.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Funding:</strong> The authors declared that this study received no financial support.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#methods\">Methods</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#results\">Results</a><a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#discussion\">Discussion</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"reference\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Reference</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>REFERENCES</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Choudhury AA, Devi Rajeswari V.
