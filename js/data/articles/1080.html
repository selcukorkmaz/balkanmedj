<p>
	Hepatic encephalopathy is characterized by neuropsychiatric abnormalities occurring in patients with liver dysfunction. It most commonly occurs in association with cirrhosis, portal hypertension, portal-systemic shunts and acute liver failure. Clinical features of hepatic encephalopathy varies between mild cognitive impairment to deep coma. Several neuroimaging techniques, especially magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may eventually be useful for the diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. Cranial MRI may demonstrate high signal intensity in the bilateral globus pallidum on T1-weighted images. Cortical involvement due to hepatic encephalopathy is rarely reported in the literature. We presented here a case of hepatic encephalopathy with cortical and subcortical involvement.</p>
