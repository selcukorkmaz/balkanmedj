	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Cardiovascular diseases are more common among first degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients than healthy subjects without a family history of diabetes. Plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and homocysteine (Hcy) levels are markers of endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate levels of ADMA, Hcy and their association with cardiovascular risk factors in first degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: The circulating ADMA and Hcy levels were measured in 15 first degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients and 15 control subjects without a known family history of diabetes.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: No statistically significant differences were found in plasma levels of ADMA and Hcy between the two groups (p&gt;0.05). Plasma ADMA levels correlated significantly with waist circumference (p=0.02), fasting insulin levels (p=0.03), insulin resistance (p=0.01), total cholesterol (p=0.04) and HDL-cholesterol (p=0.03) levels in the first degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: These results suggest that plasma ADMA levels do not directly contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction in first degree relatives of type 2 diabetic patients with cardiovascular risk factors.</p>
