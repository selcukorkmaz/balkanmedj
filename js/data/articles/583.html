	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Renal cell carcinoma derived from tubular epithelium is one of the malignant tumors of the kidney. We have investigated the histological features, pathological stage, nuclear grade and sarcomatoid differentiation of these tumors.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Histological slides from seventy-eight nephrectomy specimens diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma between 2000 and 2008 were reevaluated according to the 2004 World Health Organization classification system of kidney tumors. Reclassified cases were collected in five groups and were scored for Fuhrman nuclear grading, stage, sarcomatoid differentiation and survival rate.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: In our study, cases with high nuclear grade, advanced stage and sarcomatoid differentiation revealed poor survival rates (p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, the correlation between prognostic histopathological parameters and survival rates was consistent with literature findings.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Fuhrman nuclear grading, stage and sarcomatoid differentiation are important parameters and are related factors in survival when investigating renal cell carcinomas. Fuhrman nuclear grading must be evaluated correctly and the highest grade should be reported. Although there aren&#39;t enough studies about sarcomatoid differentiation, its presence significantly decreases survival rates. It is very important to state histopathological parameters including sarcomatoid differentiation precisely on the pathology report.</p>
