	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease which may be accompanied by cognitive impairments. The expression of the obesity gene (ob) is decreased in insulin-deficient diabetic animals and increased after the administration of insulin or leptin. Plasma leptin levels are reduced in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Therefore, the deleterious effects of diabetes on memory may be due to the reduction of leptin.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: Investigate the effect of subcutaneous injection of leptin on spatial learning and memory in STZ-induced diabetic rats.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study&nbsp;Design</strong>: Animal experimentation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: The rats were divided into three groups: 1- control, 2- diabetic, and 3- diabetic-leptin. Diabetes was induced in groups 2 and 3 by STZ injection (55 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (i.p). The animals received leptin (0.1 mg/kg) or saline subcutaneously (s.c) for 10 days before behavioral studies. Then, they were examined in the Morris water maze over 3 blocks after 3 days of the last injection of leptin.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The travelled path length and time spent to reach the platform significantly increased in the diabetic group (p&lt;0.001) and decreased with leptin treatment (p&lt;0.01 &amp; p&lt;0.001 respectively); also, a significant increase in path length and time was observed between the diabetic-leptin group and the diabetic group (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.001, respectively) in the probe test.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Leptin can exert positive effects on memory impairments in diabetic rats.</p>
