	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the hemostatic agent (FastAct) exerts favourable effect on wound healing and tissue repair alone and along with prilocaine hydrochloride in vivo. Wound healing process is a complex procedure that starts with bleeding and hemostasis. Comprising of bovine factor proteins II, VII, IX and X, FastAct is used as a catalyst in the clot formation process to activate factors II, V, VIII and XIII.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Materials and Methods</strong>: The study was performed on 21 Wistar male rats. Cutaneous incisions at the length of 4 cm. were made on the dorsal side of all animals. In seven, FastAct was applied alone between the wound edges and, in the other seven, FastAct was applied along with prilocaine. The wounds were sutured by resorbable suture material.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: The specimens were obtained on the seventh day. Wound breaking strength test was performed before histological examination. In the FastAct group the epithelialization and the closure of the wound edge were better than the other groups. The results of the breaking strength test showed that the results were best in FastAct group.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: It&#39;s concluded that FastAct accomplished hemostasis, facilitated wound healing in accordance with natural processes.</span></p>
