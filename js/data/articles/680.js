On the 3&#39; and 5&#39; ends of the genome, there are two untranslated regions (UTR) which are highly protected and which have 92% homology among various HCV types. 5&#39; UTR is used for the genotype detection. In this study, genotype and nucleic acid changes in this region were analyzed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: In 51 patients diagnosed with HCV, HCV-RNA was isolated and purified from serum samples. The 341 nucleotide-long UTR region at the 5&#39;end of the genome was sequenced and genotypes were detected. Nucleotide changes were analyzed with on-line BLAST program.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: In 45 (88.2%) of 51 patients, genotype-1 (78.4% of all genotypes were 1b, 9.8% were 1a) was detected. In 41 (80.4%) of the 51 sequences, nucleic acid changes were detected. These changes generally occurred as an insertion in codon 84 ; deletion in codon 43 and codon 46; transversion in codon 15, 17 and 18, and transition in codon 62. No significant relationship was found between viral load and nucleic acid changes.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although the 5&#39;UTR region is a protected region, mutation can be observed, and the mutations may affect the genotype, viral load and treatment response. Therefore, further investigation is required in a large series</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
