Immunohistochemically, oestrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and HER2 primary antibodies were evaluated in both frozen and non-frozen sections of each tumour sample.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: No difference was found between the frozen and non-frozen sections in 33 cases in terms of staining rate and intensity of ER, PR and HER2. A decrease was found in the ER, PR and HER2 staining rate (in 10 cases, 9 cases and 6 cases, respectively). Likewise, a decrease was detected in ER, PR and HER2 staining intensity in 6 patients for each. Although there was no staining in frozen sections, immunopositivity was observed in 3 non-frozen sections for ER, in 2 for PR and in 5 for HER2. Statistically, a significant difference was found between the frozen and non-frozen sections in terms of staining rate and intensity for each of the three markers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this study, the frozen section procedure in breast carcinoma had a negative effect on the immunoprofile. However, considering the importance of hormone receptor status in the treatment, these results should be supported with larger series.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
