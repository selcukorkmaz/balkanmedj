	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Studies on body composition are primarily concerned with somatotypes and measuring adiposity. The object of this study was to determine some body proportions of handballers.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: The study included 57 male handballers from six teams competing in the regional first league between universities. Body proportions were determined using anthropometric measuring techniques, and percent adiposity with the use of a Holtain skinfold caliper according to the Yuhasz&#39; technique.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The handballers were found to be normal according to body mass index, medium built according to the Cormique index, mezotiskelie according to the Monourier index, broad-shouldered according to acromio-iliac index, and narrow-hipped according to the hip index. The mean body fat percentage was measured as 16.7&plusmn;4.1.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Due to peculiar features of handball, the players are expected to have wider shoulders and narrower hips than normal individuals. Although some of these anthropometric features can be acquired by means of constant exercises, taking these into consideration while choosing appropriate candidates will surely have a positive influence on future success.</p>
