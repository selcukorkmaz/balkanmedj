	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: To determine the effects of dimenhydrinate (DMH) and ondansetron, used as antiemetics during pregnancy, on the length of gestation, maternal weight gain during gestation and postnatal morphometric parameters of pups.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Thirty female Wistar albino rats were used in the study. Three groups comprising 10 rats each were studied: Group 1: control group; Group 2: DMH group; and Group 3: ondansetron group. Rats were impregnated and administered 115 mg/kg/day intramuscular, DMH group, or 10 mg/ kg/day intraperitoneal, ondansetron group. The parameters pertaining to the cranium, thorax and limbs were measured between newborn and adulthood.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The increase in mean morphometric parameters during the postnatal period in the DMH group was less than the control group,whereas that in the ondansetron group exceeded the controls (p&lt;0.05). Moreover, when data obtained between weeks 7 and 11 were analyzed for males and females separately, morphometric parameters increased at a slower rate in the DMH than the control group and morphometric parameters increased at a higher rate in the ondansetron than the control group in either sex (p&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: DMH and ondansetron used during gestation affect weight gain during gestation, and morphometric development of pups during newborn and lactation periods and adulthood.</p>
