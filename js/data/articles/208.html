	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Cluster headache (CH) is a primary headache which has highly specific and sensitive criteria, and notpresence of an aura. It has been recently reported that CH may not presence with aura more than ever and this condition will be identified by headache specialists as a new form of CH.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: As there is no report to our knowledge on Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) manifested as CH aura in the literature, we present a case of a 35-year-old man having AIWS as CH aura.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Clinically, AIWS is not uncommon and is likely to be underestimated as a diagnostic entity. Valproate may be preferred for treatment in CH patients with AIWS aura.</p>
