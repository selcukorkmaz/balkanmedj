												        						<p><strong>Background:</strong> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) could be implicated in tumorigenesis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).<br /><strong>Aims:</strong> To determine the role of MiR-216a in DLBCL.<br /><strong>Study Design:</strong> Cell culture study.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> Expression of miR-216a in DLBCL cells was examined by qRT-PCR. Cell counting kit-8, bromodeoxyuridine staining and transwell assays were performed to evaluate role of miR-216a on DLBCL cell growth. Target gene of miR-216a was verified by luciferase reporter assay.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> MiR-216a was dramatically reduced in DLBCL cells compared to the normal B-cell line (P &lt; .01). MiR-216a reduced the viability and retarded DLBCL cell proliferation. The invasion of DLBCL was suppressed by miR-216a. Y box binding protein 1 (YBX1) was validated as a target of miR-216a. Its expression was reduced by miR-216a mimic and enhanced by miR-216a inhibitor in DB and SU-DHL-10 cells. Knockdown of YBX1 reduced cell viability, proliferation, and invasion of DB and SU-DHL-10 cells.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> MiR-216a exerted tumor-suppressive effects on DLBCL cells through inhibition of YBX1, providing a new strategy for DLBCL.</p>												        					</div>
