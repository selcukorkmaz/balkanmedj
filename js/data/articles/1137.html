	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The aim of this study was to determine range of motion values of lumbar spine in Turkish people by using 3D motion analysis method.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: The study included 100 subjects (50 males, 50 females; range 18 to 22 years). The Zebris&reg; 3D Motion Analysis System was used for the measurement. Lateral bending, flexion, extension, pelvic tilt were evaluated in the measurements.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The average value for total lateral flexion at lumbar spine was found to be 51.3&deg;&plusmn;7.5 in males and 52.7&deg;&plusmn;9.9 in females. Total flexion-extension was 81.0&deg;&plusmn;11.1 in males and 80.2&deg;&plusmn;10.2 in females. L4-L5 flexion, L5-S1 extension values were statistically high in women (p&lt;0.05) while L3-L4 total flexion- extension and L1-L2 total lateral flexion values were statistically high in men (p&lt;0.05). The support of pelvic tilt to total lumbosacral flexion was 46.6% in males and 42.1% in females. The support was 36.8% in males and 26.2% in females during extension. Flexion and extension of pelvic tilt values in men were found to be significantly higher than that in women (p&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The normal values of movements of lumbar spine in Turkish people have been determined with 3D motion analysis system</p>
