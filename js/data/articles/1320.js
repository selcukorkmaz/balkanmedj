All patients were questioned with respect to demographic characteristics, initial types of symptoms, and risk factors. Symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings, and musculoskeletal involvement were recorded and plain radiographies were assessed.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Seventeen patients (65.4%) presented with acute, and nine patients (34.6%) presented with chronic symptoms. Clinical and radiographic assessments showed spondylitis in 12 patients, of which 10 patients had lumbar involvement. Sacroileitis was detected in 10 patients, being unilateral in six. Peripheral arthritis was detected in seven patients (26.9%), and the most commonly affected peripheral joint was the knee. In addition, eight patients had abscess, and four had neurological involvement.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The most common musculoskeletal involvement in brucellosis is spondylitis, mainly affecting the lumbar segments. Patients with musculoskeletal complications should be investigated for paraspinal abscesses and monitored closely for neurological deficits.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
