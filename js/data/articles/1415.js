The presenting complaints, medical history, laboratory data including blood count and routine biochemical assessments, imaging and ophtalmoscopic evaluation data were evaluated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Headache was the primary symptom (85.7%) on admission. The other presenting symptoms were visual impairment (47.6%), tinnitus (19.0%), nausea-vomiting (38.1%). Papilledema was found in 15 patients (71.4%), nasal and temporal swollen of optic disc in 4 patients (19.0%). Two patients had normal fundus examination. Eight (38.1%) had brain edema. Four out of 16 patients who underwent visual evoked potential, had prolonged P100 latency. Headache and visual symptoms were improved within 8 months follow-up period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In conclusion, although idiopathic intracranial hypertenson has good prognosis, it may rarely cause permanent visual loss. For this reason, IIH should be considered in young and obese women presenting with headache, visual and auditive symptoms.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
