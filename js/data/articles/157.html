	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Background</strong>: Myxopapillary ependymomas are well differentiated low-grade tumors which have been documented to local or distant metastasis. In the literature, this is a unique case of myxopapillary ependymoma with metastasis to the uterine cervix. Here, we present a rare case of extra neural metastasis of spinal ependymoma that developed over a long period.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Case&nbsp;Report</strong>: A 34-year-old woman was referred to our hospital for pelvic mass. A mass (110x100 mm) localized between the sacrococcygeal region and the uterus was detected by magnetic resonance imaging. In 2004, she had been operated upon for myxopapillary ependymoma seated in the sacrococcygeal region for the first time. She underwent tumor resection eight times due to the recurrence of spinal tumor in the same region in nine years. Under the diagnosis of uterine neoplasm, we carried out radical hysterectomy, omentectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy as the surgical procedure. The pathological findings were reported as myxopapillary ependymoma. Immunohistochemically, the myxopapillary ependymal cells showed strong positivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein, whereas they were negative for low molecular weight cytokeratin. The Ki-67 labeling index was about 2-3%. The patient had an uneventful postoperative period. She has remained free of symptoms in the year since surgery.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Extra-spinal myxopapillary ependymoma is very rare, but it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of pelvic mass lesions.</p>
