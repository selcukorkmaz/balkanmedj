	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: We compared the success rates of medical faculty graduates in the Internship Selection Examination for Medical Doctors (TUS) following different education systems.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: The study included Medicine Faculty students of Trakya University, who received education between 1987 and 1995, during which two different education systems, namely an integrated system and the classical system were implemented between 1987-1992 and 1993-1995, respectively. The place of our faculty was found according to the average Clinical Medicine and Basic Medicine scores of the graduates in the first TUS following their graduation and a comparison was made between the two systems. The effect of different education systems were assessed on the TUS scores.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Compared to the &Ouml;YS placement, the students who were enroled in the integrated system obtained higher TUS scores in only three out of 12 examinations. However, TUS scores were higher than those of OYS placement in five out of six examinations in the students who received the classical system.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The results show that the classical education system is associated with higher success rates in TUS scores.</p>
