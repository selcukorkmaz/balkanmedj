It is important that pregnant women should stay away from factors that have an effect on their mental health for themselves and their babies. The aim of this study was to determine the anxiety and depression levels and effecting factors in third trimester pregnant women living in Edirne, Turkey.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: A questionnaire including items about socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics, state anxiety inventory, Beck depression scale for primary care and WHOQOOL-BREF(TR) quality of life scale was applied to 340 last trimester pregnant women determined in Edirne, Turkey between April-June 2007.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: It was the first pregnancy for 56.6% and a wanted one in 90.9% of them. There was not an important health problem in 97.7% of participants; smoking rate in pregnancy was 14.4%. Average physician visits was 7.2 times and 85% of them did not receive any home visit by midwives. Anxiety level decreased by age. Crowded families, low socio-economic status, unwanted pregnancies, cigarette and alcohol consumption increased depression level.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Enhancing the socio-economic and educational status, surveying mental state and affecting factors in pregnancy follow-ups would provide a healthy pregnancy period for pregnant women.</span></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
