This paper reports a case of leptospirosis in Pleven, Bulgaria, in which the subject was infected after wading through irrigative canal in northern Greece. Two days later, he had a fever, myalgia and vomiting followed by jaundice, darkness of urine and oliguria. The patient was admitted to Clinic of Infectious Diseases at University Hospital-Pleven after returning to Bulgaria. The history and laboratory findings suggested icterohaemorrhagic leptospirosis. Penicillin G was prescribed and intensive supportive treatment was initiated. Dialysis was performed two hours after admission and was followed by poliuric stage of acute renal failure (peak urine output 16 600 mL/day). Microaglutination test (MAT) for sero-diagnosis was positive (L. hardjo 1:1600, L. icterohaemorrhagiae 1:800). The patient was discharged after sixteen days with improved renal and liver functions. In conclusion, The probability of leptospirosis should not be ignored in patients with fever after returning from abroad. The prompt dialysis and adequate treatment improve prognosis.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
