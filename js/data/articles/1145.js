The data regarding patient age, sex, surgical procedure, postoperative histopathologic results and follow-up time were recorded.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: One of the male patients underwent operation twice because of the bilateral parotid mass. According to the postoperative histopathologic results, 37 of the cases were benign (64.9%), and 20 of them were malign (35.1%). Pleomorphic adenoma (13 patients) and Whartin tumor (13 patients) incidence were similar. Partial superficial parotidectomy, superficial parotidectomy, and total parotidectomy were performed. In addition, some of the patients underwent neck dissection. The most frequent complication was transient facial nerve paresis.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: For the management of benign parotid gland tumors, superficial or partial superficial parotidectomy is a sufficient surgery. For malign tumors, superficial or total parotidectomy; in cases with neck masses, neck dissection; and in cases involving the facial nerve, facial nerve resection and reconstruction should be performed. According to the type of tumor, postoperative radiation therapy and chemotherapy should be performed as well.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
