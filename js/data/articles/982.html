	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: It was aimed to investigate anaplasmosis seropositivity in people exposured to tick bite.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Materials and Methods</strong>: A total of 116 individuals (89 males, 27 females; mean age 43; range 6 to 88 years) with tick bite history in rural areas of Thrace Region were included in this study. Possible risk factors were evaluated by a questionnaire. Sera obtained from volunteers were preserved in &ndash;70˚C deep freezer until the study is done. Antibodies against Anaplasma phagocytophilum were investigated by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test in the sera.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: Antibodies against A. phagocytophilum were positive for 29 individuals (25%). Contact with horse/donkey is defined as a risk factor for anaplasmosis seropositivity.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Antibodies against A. phagocytophilum were found at high rates in people exposured to tick bite in rural areas of Thrace Region.</span></p>
