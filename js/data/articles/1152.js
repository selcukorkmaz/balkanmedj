The subjects did not have any physical defects. The average age in females and males were 19.4&plusmn;1.0 years and 20.1&plusmn;1.4 years respectively. Measurements were made by the same researcher using the same millimetric calipers at the same place and at the same time of day.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The height of head, the height of face, the height of superior face and the height of inferior face were measured as 20.0/21.32 cm, 11.15/11.84 cm, 5.09/5.24 cm and 6.21/6.82 cm for females/males respectively. The proportions between these parameters were 55.75%/55.53% for the height of face to the height of head, 25.45%/24.57% for the height of upper face to the height of head, 31.05%/31.98% for the height of lower face to the height of head, 45.65%/44.25% for the height of upper face to the height of face and 55.69%/57.60% for the height of lower face to the height of face, in females/males respectively.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We compared the results which are peculiar to Turkish people with the literature. We believe that the results of our study would be useful for other studies on the native Turkish people.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
