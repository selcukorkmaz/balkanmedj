	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: High levels of TGF-&beta;1 and enhanced TGF-&beta;1 receptor signaling are related to the pathology of gastric cancer. This effect is caused by oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation products. The aim of this study was to investigate the levels of TGF-&beta;1 and lipid peroxidation products in gastric cancer patients and their correlation with pathologic stage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Lipid peroxidation products and TGF-&beta;1 levels were studied in the serum samples of 50 gastric cancer patients and 18 control subjects.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: HNE-protein adducts and TGF-&beta;1 levels were significantly higher in T2, T3 and T4 gastric cancers than in either the T1 stage or controls (p&lt;0.001). Pathologic stage was correlated with TGF-&beta;1 levels (r=0.702, p&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: These markers production may contribute to tumor angiogenesis and aid in the prognosis of the gastric cancer.</p>												        					</div>
