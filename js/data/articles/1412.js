First, the refractive status of all cases was determined by automatic refractometer and the visual acuities with and without correction were determined by the Snellen chart. The cases were classified into two groups, as having anisohypermetropia and anisomyopia, following determination of the corneal parameters with corneal topography and axial length with the A Scan ultrasonography, and the parameters of the eyes with and without ambliyopia were compared.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: There were statistically significant differences between the two eyes of the cases with anisohypermetropic ambliyopia in terms of spherical value, spherical equivalent, anterior-posterior axial length, vitreous length, total corneal astigmatism, corneal astigmatism in the 3 mm and 5 mm area. Patients with anisomyopia had statistically significant differences between the two eyes in terms of spherical equivalence, cylindrical value, vitreous length, corneal astigmatism in the 3 mm and 5 m area.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: While axial length and/or corneal astigmatism were responsible for refractive error in cases with anisohypermetropic ambliyopia, only corneal astigmatism was observed to be responsible in cases with anisomyopic amblyopia.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
