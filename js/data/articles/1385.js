In all 7 of the cases with TDC, the mass presented with a cutaneus fistula. Two of the branchial cysts were localized on the right and the rest on the left side. One of the cases with dermoid cyst exhibited a lateral localization. Ultrasonography, computed tomography and thyroid syntigraphy were used for diagnostic purposes. Three patients with torticollis received physical therapy while the remaining patients were surgically treated. The preliminary diagnosis was incorrect in four cases and their histopathological diagnosis was dermoid cyst.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Congenital neck masses in children are usually benign. Due to their similar clinical features, dermoid cysts can be confused with TDC and branchial cysts.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
