Postural and coordination exercises could ameliorate the incoordination and decrease falls.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: In this study, we explored the efficiency of a game console as an adjunct to an exercise program in treating incoordination in patients with PD.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Study Design:</strong>&nbsp;Case-control study.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: In this single-blind, prospective clinical trial, rehabilitation with the Xbox (Microsoft; Washington, USA) game console was used as an adjunct to a standard rehabilitation program. Thirty-three patients with PD at stages 1-3 were enrolled in the study. All patients received the threetimes weekly exercise program and electrotherapy to back and hip extensors for 5 weeks. Study patients played catch the ball and obstacle games on the Xbox in addition to the standard exercise program. Patients were evaluated based on the scores from the Timed Up-and-Go Test, the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and the Unified Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale-II (UPDRS-II). Post-treatment scores were compared between groups.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the study (15 in the game-console group, and 18 controls). Patients in both groups had improvements in all scores. The end-oftreatment scores were significantly better in the study group compared to the control group in all parameters: UPDRS (10&plusmn;5 versus 16&plusmn;6, p=0.002), BBS (53&plusmn;4 versus 47&plusmn;8, p=0.004), and TUG (11&plusmn;4 seconds versus 20&plusmn;8 seconds, p&lt;0.001).</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Game-exercise with a game-console was noted to be a significant adjunct to the rehabilitation program in patients with PD in this study.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
