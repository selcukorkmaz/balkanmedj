	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Uterine lipoleiomyoma is a rare and specific type of leiomyoma with a considerable amount of adipocytes.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical, pathological and immunohistochemical features of lipoleiomyoma of the uterine corpus, and review its histogenesis and differential diagnosis from other neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions in order to obtain a detailed profile of this somewhat uncommon lesion.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Descriptive study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: This study is a retrospective analysis of 70 consecutive women with 76 lipoleiomyomas, who underwent surgery mainly for uterine leiomyoma and gynecological carcinomas between January 2000 and April 2013. Clinical and pathological information was obtained from medical records. Immunohistochemistry was applied in selected cases. Parametric methods were used to compare clinical and pathologic features.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The patients ranged in age from 34 to 77 years (mean 55.49 years). Lipoleiomyomas ranged from 0.5 to 55 cm in diameter (mean 5.50 cm). Typical macroscopic and microscopic features were noted. Sixty-nine (90.7%) tumors were in the uterine corpus and five (6.5%) were in the cervix. One broad ligament tumor and one retroperitoneal tumor were also studied. No tumors displayed cytologic atypia, mitosis, necrosis, calcification, or other degenerative changes. Immunohistochemically, the adipose tissue element was positive for vimentin, desmin, S100 protein, estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), and Ki-67. Among patients with lipoleiomyomas, 53 cases (75.7%) had different types of lesions associated with hyperestrogenic status, such as adenomyosis, endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and polyps, complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia, and gynecologic carcinomas. The follow-up period ranged from one to eight years (mean 4.6 years). There were no recurrences or tumor-related fatalities.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In the present study, the lipoleiomyomas were seen more frequently in patients with adenomyosis, endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia, polyps, and various gynecologic carcinomas. Lipoleiomyoma of the uterus seems to have a benign clinical course.</p>
