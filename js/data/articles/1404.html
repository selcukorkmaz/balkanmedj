	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The facility of genetic manipulation in mice offers a promising approach in the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain. But, since experimental neuropathic pain models in mice are insufficient, there is a need to develop new models.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: We described a novel, easily performed, mouse model of neuropathic pain based on a unilateral tight ligation of the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve. In this model, the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve was tightly ligated and the common peroneal and the sural branches were left intact. Nerve injury-induced mechanical allodynia was assessed with von Frey filaments, and a plantar analgesic meter was used to assess thermal hyperalgesia.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia developed within 3 days after tibial nerve ligation and was present during the one month measurement period.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Tibial nerve ligation, is a new, modified experimental model which enables the use of mice in neuropathic pain experiments and may especially be useful in clarifying mechanisms of neuropathic pain in genetically modified mice.</p>
