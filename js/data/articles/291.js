It is related to several chronic diseases such as essential hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and renal disease. The relationship between the degree of obesity and lung functions is well defined in adults, but limited information is available about the childhood period.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: This study aims to determine the impact of the degree of obesity on the pulmonary functions of school children and adolescents.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study&nbsp;Design</strong>: Cross sectional study.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: Included in the study were a total of 170 school children and adolescents (9-17 years old) referred to our paediatric outpatient clinic. Of these subjects, 42 were lean and non-obese (BMI % &lt;85), 30 subjects were overweight (BMI % ˃85, &lt;95), 34 subjects were obese (BMI % ˃95, &lt;97), and 64 subjects were morbidly obese (BMI % ˃97). Anthropometric measurements were taken and spirometry was performed on all subjects. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity 25-75 (FEV25-75) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were used to measure the ventilatory functions for all the subjects.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The groups showed no significant differences in age or gender. Despite no statistically significant differences in FEV1, FVC, or FEV1/FVC, there were significant reductions in PEF (p&lt;0.001) and FEV25-75 (p&lt;0.001) in the overweight, obese and morbidly obese subjects, when compared with those who were non-obese.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Overweight, obese and morbidly obese children have no obstructive abnormalities compared with healthy lean subjects.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
