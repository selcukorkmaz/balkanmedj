	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: In our experience Allergic Rhinitis (AR) patients suffer from voice problems more than health subjects.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: To investigate the acoustic analysis of voice, stroscopic findings of larynx and Voice Handicap Index scores in allergic rhinitis patients compared with healthy controls.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case-control study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Thirty adult patients diagnosed with perennial allergic rhinitis were compared with 30 age- and sex-matched healthy controls without allergy. All assessments were performed in the speech physiology laboratory and the testing sequence was as follows: 1. Voice Handicap Index (VHI) questionnaire, 2. Laryngovideostroboscopy, 3. Acoustic analyses.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: No difference was observed between the allergic rhinitis and control groups regarding mean Maximum Phonation Time (MPT) values, Fo values, and stroboscopic assessment (p&gt;0.05). On the other hand, mean VHI score (p=0.001) and s/z ratio (p=0.011) were significantly higher in the allergic rhinitis group than in controls.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings suggest that the presence of allergies could have effects on laryngeal dysfunction and voice-related quality of life.&nbsp;</p>
