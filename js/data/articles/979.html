	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: This study was undertaken to investigate copper, zinc, iron, and selenium in a rat model of cadmium toxicity and effects of antioxidant substances such as taurine, melatonin and N-acetylcysteine.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Materials and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: Ninety male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into nine groups. Group 1 received tap water comprising the controls; the remaining eight groups received 200 &micro;g/ml cadmium chloride (CdCl2) for three months. Group 2 had CdCl2. Groups 3, 4, and 5 were administered taurine, melatonin and N-acetylcystein for three months together with CdCl2. Groups 6, 7, 8, and 9 had CdCl2 for three months and then only water as the second control or antioxidants for seven days. Cadmium, copper, zinc, iron, and selenium levels of heart and brain were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: Cadmium accumulated in significant amounts in brain and heart tissues when compared with controls. CdCl2 levels in Group 1 and Group 2 were 2.56&plusmn;0.77 and 27.2&plusmn;5.82 in the heart, 46.16&plusmn;14.81 and 300.34&plusmn;58.19 in the brain, respectively (p&lt;0.001). We found that melatonin was more effective in brain tissue (p&lt;0.05) whereas N-acetylcysteine was more effective in heart tissue (p&lt;0.001) against cadmium accumulation.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We suggest that taurine, melatonin and N-acetylcysteine have some protective effects in brain and heart tissues against cadmium accumulation. Furthermore, trace element levels were restorated in different degrees after taurine, melatonin and N-acetylcysteine administration.</span></p>
