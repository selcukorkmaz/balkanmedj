However there have been limited studies considering the effect of FDG-PET in the initial evaluation of CRC. We analysed how FDG-PET affects the management of patients with CRC preoperatively.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: A prospective study of 26 consecutive patients with known or suspected CRC was undertaken. The patients were evaluated by computed tomography (CT) and FDG-PET. FDG-PET results were compared with those of CT and correlated with histopathologic findings or with clinical course.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: FDG-PET had a sensitivity of 96% and positive predictive value of 100% for the diagnosis of primary cancer, while CT had values of 68% and 95%, respectively. FDG-PET was superior to CT in detecting additional metastatic disease with a sensitivity of 89%, while CT had 33%. FDG-PET resulted in altered management for 8 patients of whom three avoided inappropriate surgery.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is concluded that FDG-PET is highly sensitive for the diagnosis and staging of patients with CRC. Its use in conjunction with CT results in a more accurate selection of patients for surgical treatment with curative intent.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
