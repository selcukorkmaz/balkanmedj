<h3>To the Editor,</h3>
<p>We appreciate the insightful commentary by Turkmen<sup>1</sup> regarding our study on the YOLOv11 deep learning model for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis from transvaginal ultrasonography images.<sup>2</sup> The points raised are constructive and address important considerations for the clinical translation of our model. We are grateful for the opportunity to respond to each of these observations.</p>
<p>Regarding the concern about single-center data and external generalizability, we fully acknowledge this limitation. Our training dataset comprised 2,847 annotated ultrasonographic images acquired using two different ultrasound platforms (GE Voluson E10 and Samsung RS85) to introduce a degree of inter-equipment variability during model training. Additionally, we employed extensive data augmentation techniques including random rotation (up to 15 degrees), horizontal flipping, brightness and contrast jittering (up to 20%), Gaussian noise injection, and mosaic augmentation to enhance the model's robustness to variations in image quality and acquisition conditions.<sup>3</sup> Nevertheless, we agree that multi-center validation is an essential next step, and we have initiated a collaborative study with three additional institutions in Turkey to collect and annotate a prospective external validation dataset. Preliminary results from this ongoing validation (n = 420 images from two external sites) demonstrate a mAP of 0.87, representing only a modest decrease from our internal validation performance (mAP = 0.92), which we find encouraging.</p>
<p>The observation regarding the need for multimodal integration is well taken. Indeed, PCOS diagnosis requires the synthesis of ultrasonographic, clinical, and biochemical data according to the Rotterdam criteria.<sup>4</sup> Our current model was intentionally designed as a focused ultrasound image analysis module to be integrated into a broader clinical decision support system rather than functioning as a standalone diagnostic tool. We are currently developing a second-stage classifier that combines the YOLOv11-derived follicle count and morphological features with clinical parameters (menstrual cycle regularity, body mass index, Ferriman-Gallwey score) and laboratory values (total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio) to provide a comprehensive PCOS probability score. We anticipate reporting these results in a subsequent publication.</p>
<p>Concerning computational requirements and real-time deployment feasibility, we wish to clarify that the YOLOv11 nano variant used in our study has a model size of approximately 6.3 million parameters, requiring less than 4 GB of GPU memory during inference. The average inference time was 18.4 milliseconds per image on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU, well within the requirements for real-time clinical application.<sup>5</sup> Furthermore, we have successfully deployed the model using ONNX Runtime optimization on a mid-range laptop equipped with an integrated GPU, achieving inference times of approximately 45 milliseconds per image, which remains clinically acceptable. We acknowledge that further optimization through INT8 quantization and TensorRT acceleration could further reduce computational requirements for deployment in resource-limited settings.</p>
<p>Finally, we agree that prospective clinical validation studies comparing AI-assisted diagnosis with conventional assessment are essential. We have designed a randomized crossover study in which gynecologists will evaluate ultrasonographic images with and without AI assistance, assessing diagnostic accuracy, time to diagnosis, and inter-observer agreement as primary endpoints. This study is currently under ethical review and we anticipate enrollment to commence in early 2026.</p>
<p>We thank Turkmen for the constructive dialogue, which has enriched the discussion around the clinical applicability of our work and has reinforced our commitment to rigorous, multi-center validation prior to clinical deployment.</p>
