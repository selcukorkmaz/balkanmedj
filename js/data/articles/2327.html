												        						<p><strong>Aims</strong>: To assess the perioperative and short-term functional and oncologic&nbsp;outcomes of the salvage robot-assisted radical prostatectomy&nbsp;(sRARP), after recurrence following primary proton beam therapy for&nbsp;clinically localized prostate cancer.<br /><strong>Methods</strong>: Ten patients undergoing sRARP after failure of the prior&nbsp;definitive proton beam therapy for localized prostate cancer were&nbsp;included. BCR is defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value of&nbsp;2.0 ng/mL greater than the absolute nadir. All of the individuals had a&nbsp;diagnosis of prostate cancer via biopsy after proton beam therapy, with&nbsp;negative findings on magnetic resonance imaging/computer tomography&nbsp;of the pelvis and abdomen, and a bone scan. The sRARP procedure&nbsp;with pelvic lymph node dissection was performed by a single surgeon&nbsp;in all patients.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: The median age of the cohort at sRARP was 66.8 years, and&nbsp;the mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m2. The mean duration from proton beam&nbsp;therapy to sRARP was 58.4 months; the mean preoperative PSA level&nbsp;was 5.5 ng/mL, the mean operative time was 230 minutes, and the&nbsp;approximate blood loss was 745 mL. Anastomotic leakage occurred&nbsp;in half of the individuals, and bladder neck contracture developed in&nbsp;6 patients. For 8 patients, the continence results within 6 months followup&nbsp;were available. Overall, 24 complications occurred in 9 patients. At&nbsp;follow-up in the 32nd month, the overall survival rate was 80%, and the&nbsp;BCR-free survival rate was 90%.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: sRARP after proton beam therapy is an applicable procedure,&nbsp;but has a high risk of serious complications.</p>												        					</div>
