<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS; OMIM #605130) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, short stature, distinctive facial features, and hypertrichosis, particularly of the elbows. The condition was first described by Wiedemann et al. in 1989 and further delineated by Steiner and Marques in 2000. The molecular basis of WSS was established in 2012 when Jones et al. identified heterozygous pathogenic variants in the KMT2A gene (also known as MLL) as the causative genetic defect through exome sequencing. Since then, with increasing availability of clinical exome and genome sequencing, the number of molecularly confirmed cases has grown substantially, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the phenotypic spectrum.</p>
<p>The KMT2A gene, located on chromosome 11q23.3, encodes a histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase that plays a critical role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression during embryonic development and postnatal growth. KMT2A belongs to the trithorax group of chromatin regulators and is essential for the maintenance of HOX gene expression patterns, neural development, and hematopoiesis. Pathogenic variants in KMT2A associated with WSS span the entire coding sequence and include missense, nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site variants, with the majority predicted to result in haploinsufficiency through loss-of-function mechanisms. As KMT2A is a chromatin modifier, WSS is classified among the chromatinopathies, a growing group of neurodevelopmental disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding components of the epigenetic machinery.</p>
<p>The clinical phenotype of WSS has expanded considerably since its initial description. Beyond the core features of intellectual disability, short stature, and hypertrichosis, a wide range of additional manifestations has been reported, including ophthalmologic abnormalities, congenital heart defects, skeletal anomalies, genitourinary malformations, immunological dysfunction, and endocrine disturbances. Growth hormone deficiency has been identified in a substantial proportion of patients, suggesting that KMT2A plays a role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-growth hormone axis. However, the full extent of phenotypic variability and the genotype-phenotype correlations in WSS remain to be fully elucidated, particularly in populations outside Western Europe and North America.</p>
<p>In this multicenter Turkish study, we present the clinical and molecular findings of 16 individuals from 15 unrelated families with molecularly confirmed WSS. Our cohort includes 15 distinct KMT2A variants, nine of which are novel, thereby expanding the mutational spectrum of this disorder. We provide a comprehensive clinical characterization encompassing growth, neurodevelopment, ophthalmologic, cardiac, dental, skeletal, genitourinary, and immunological features, and we discuss genotype-phenotype correlations in the context of the existing literature.</p>

<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>
<p>This multicenter retrospective study included patients with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of WSS evaluated at six tertiary pediatric genetics centers across Turkey between January 2016 and December 2024. Patients were identified through a search of institutional genetic databases for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in KMT2A, and through clinical referral networks among the participating centers. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating centers, and written informed consent was obtained from the parents or legal guardians of all participants. Assent was obtained from participants with adequate cognitive capacity.</p>
<p>Clinical data were collected retrospectively from medical records using a standardized data collection form designed for this study. The form captured demographic information, family history, prenatal and perinatal history, growth parameters (height, weight, and head circumference with corresponding standard deviation scores based on Turkish growth references), developmental milestones, cognitive assessment results, and detailed organ system evaluations. All participants underwent comprehensive physical examination by clinical geneticists at the participating centers. Dysmorphological features were documented using standardized terminology from the Elements of Morphology system. Developmental assessment was performed using age-appropriate standardized instruments, including the Denver Developmental Screening Test, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, as clinically indicated.</p>
<p>Molecular genetic analysis was performed using clinical exome sequencing (CES) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) in all patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes using standard protocols. Exome capture was performed using commercially available kits (Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6 or Illumina TruSeq Exome), and paired-end sequencing was performed on Illumina platforms (HiSeq or NovaSeq) to achieve a minimum mean coverage of 100x. Bioinformatic analysis included alignment to the human reference genome (GRCh37/hg19 or GRCh38), variant calling using GATK HaplotypeCaller, and annotation using ANNOVAR and VEP. Variants in KMT2A were classified according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. All pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing, and parental testing was performed to determine the de novo status of variants.</p>
<p>Endocrine evaluation included measurement of serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), thyroid function tests, and growth hormone stimulation testing (using arginine and clonidine provocative tests) in patients with short stature (height below -2 SD). Ophthalmologic assessment included visual acuity testing, slit-lamp examination, fundoscopy, and refraction testing. Cardiac evaluation included echocardiography and electrocardiography. Immunological workup included complete blood count with differential, serum immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE), lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry, and vaccine antibody titers. Skeletal survey was performed when clinically indicated. Statistical analyses were descriptive, with continuous variables reported as median and range, and categorical variables as frequencies and percentages.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The study cohort comprised 16 individuals (10 males, 6 females) from 15 unrelated families, including one family with two affected siblings. The median age at molecular diagnosis was 4.5 years (range 1.2-16.8 years). All patients were of Turkish descent, and consanguinity was reported in two families (13.3%), consistent with the background consanguinity rate in the Turkish population. Fifteen patients carried de novo KMT2A variants, while one pair of affected siblings inherited the variant from a mildly affected mother who had not been previously diagnosed.</p>
<p>A total of 15 distinct KMT2A variants were identified, comprising six frameshift variants (40%), four nonsense variants (26.7%), three missense variants (20%), and two splice-site variants (13.3%). Nine variants (60%) were novel, not previously reported in the literature or public databases including ClinVar, HGMD, and gnomAD. The novel variants included four frameshift (c.3517delA, c.5281_5282insT, c.8104dupG, c.10567delC), two nonsense (c.4339C>T, c.7852G>T), two missense (c.3638T>C p.Leu1213Pro, c.10943A>G p.Tyr3648Cys), and one splice-site variant (c.4762+1G>A). The variants were distributed across the coding sequence, with a clustering in the PHD finger domains (4 variants) and the SET domain (3 variants). All variants were classified as pathogenic (n = 11) or likely pathogenic (n = 4) according to ACMG criteria.</p>
<p>Intellectual disability was present in all 16 patients (100%), graded as mild in 7 (43.8%), moderate in 6 (37.5%), and severe in 3 (18.8%). Speech delay was the most common developmental concern, present in 15 patients (93.8%), with first words at a median age of 24 months (range 18-48 months). Motor delay was present in 12 patients (75%), with independent walking achieved at a median age of 20 months (range 14-36 months). Behavioral features included attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in 8 patients (50%), autism spectrum features in 4 (25%), and anxiety in 3 (18.8%). Short stature (height below -2 SD) was documented in 11 patients (68.8%), and microcephaly (head circumference below -2 SD) in 5 (31.3%). The characteristic hypertrichosis of the elbows was observed in 13 patients (81.3%), and generalized hypertrichosis was noted in an additional 2 patients. Distinctive facial features, including long eyelashes, thick eyebrows, broad nasal tip, and thin upper lip, were present in all patients, though with variable expressivity.</p>
<p>Growth hormone deficiency, defined as peak growth hormone levels below 10 ng/mL on two provocative tests, was identified in 7 of 14 patients tested (50%). Of these, 5 patients were started on recombinant human growth hormone therapy, with a median treatment duration of 2.3 years (range 0.8-5.1 years). Height velocity improved significantly in all treated patients, with a mean increase of 3.2 cm/year above baseline. Ophthalmologic abnormalities were found in 9 patients (56.3%), including strabismus (n = 5), refractive errors (n = 4), amblyopia (n = 2), and ptosis (n = 2). Congenital heart defects were identified in 5 patients (31.3%), including atrial septal defect (n = 2), ventricular septal defect (n = 1), patent ductus arteriosus (n = 1), and bicuspid aortic valve (n = 1). Dental anomalies were present in 8 patients (50%), including delayed eruption, enamel hypoplasia, and malocclusion. Skeletal findings included vertebral anomalies in 3 patients, brachydactyly in 4, and joint hypermobility in 6. Genitourinary abnormalities were identified in 4 male patients, including cryptorchidism (n = 3) and hypospadias (n = 1). Immunological evaluation revealed low serum IgA levels in 3 patients and impaired vaccine responses in 2 patients, though no patient had experienced severe or recurrent infections requiring hospitalization.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>This multicenter study represents the largest reported cohort of Turkish patients with molecularly confirmed Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome and substantially expands the mutational and clinical spectrum of this disorder. The identification of nine novel KMT2A variants, accounting for 60% of our cohort, underscores the high allelic heterogeneity of WSS and highlights the ongoing need for systematic reporting of new variants to facilitate molecular diagnosis. The distribution of variant types in our cohort, with a predominance of truncating variants (66.7%), is consistent with haploinsufficiency as the primary pathogenic mechanism, in agreement with previous reports.</p>
<p>The frequency of growth hormone deficiency in our cohort (50%) is notably higher than previously reported in Western cohorts, where rates of 20-30% have been described. This discrepancy may reflect differences in ascertainment, diagnostic thresholds, or the specific KMT2A variants present in different populations. Regardless of the explanation, our findings reinforce the recommendation for systematic endocrine evaluation in all patients with WSS, particularly those with short stature. The favorable response to growth hormone therapy observed in our treated patients is consistent with prior case reports and suggests that growth hormone deficiency in WSS is amenable to hormonal replacement, potentially improving final adult height and quality of life.</p>
<p>The high prevalence of ophthalmologic abnormalities in our cohort (56.3%) extends previous observations and underscores the importance of routine ophthalmologic screening in WSS. Strabismus and refractive errors, if undetected and untreated, can compound the neurodevelopmental challenges faced by these patients by impairing visual learning and social interaction. Similarly, the identification of congenital heart defects in nearly one-third of patients warrants echocardiographic evaluation at diagnosis. The cardiac findings in our cohort were generally mild, with no patient requiring surgical intervention during the follow-up period, which is reassuring but does not obviate the need for ongoing cardiac surveillance.</p>
<p>The identification of an inherited KMT2A variant in one family, transmitted from a mildly affected mother to two children, illustrates the variable expressivity that characterizes WSS and has important implications for genetic counseling. While the majority of WSS cases arise de novo, inherited cases have been described, particularly when a parent carries a variant with reduced penetrance or mild phenotypic expression. This observation highlights the necessity of thorough parental evaluation and molecular testing in all families with an affected child, even when the parents are clinically unremarkable. The phenotypic variability observed both within and between families in our cohort likely reflects the combined effects of variant position, genetic background, and stochastic developmental factors.</p>
<p>Several limitations of our study should be noted. First, the retrospective design and variable follow-up duration across patients may have resulted in incomplete ascertainment of clinical features, particularly those that manifest later in childhood or adolescence. Second, the absence of functional studies for the novel variants limits our ability to definitively establish their pathogenic mechanisms. Third, the relatively small sample size precludes robust genotype-phenotype correlation analyses. Despite these limitations, our findings contribute meaningfully to the growing body of knowledge on WSS and provide clinically relevant data for the management of affected patients. Future prospective, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes and longitudinal follow-up will be essential to define the natural history, optimize surveillance protocols, and evaluate the long-term outcomes of therapeutic interventions in WSS.</p>
