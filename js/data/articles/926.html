	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) which is characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia and a wide range of circulating auto antibodies is a necroinflammatory liver disease of unknown aetiology. Immunogenetic studies have shown the association of autoimmunity with HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) alleles. Furthermore, they have shown a decrease in the expression of HLA antigens on lymphocyte surface and a dysregulation of gene expression arranged by HLA. A significant association is found between AIH and HLA-DRB1*03, *04 and *13 alleles in various studies. We performed HLA-DRB1 genotyping in Turkish patients with AIH.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: The study group consisted of 113 patients (55 females, 58 males; mean age 44.8&plusmn;21.21; range 10-82) with AIH and 300 healthy individuals (198 females, 102 males; mean age 32.4&plusmn;10.48; range 17-50). After DNA isolation by standard methods, HLA-DRB1 typing was performed by using polymerase chain reaction amplification with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP).</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: HLA-DRB1*03 allele had a significantly increased frequency in the patient group. On the other hand, DRB1*13 allele had a significantly decreased frequency compared with the healthy controls.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: HLA-DRB1*03 might play a role in the pathogenesis of AIH while HLA-DRB1*13 might have a protective role for AIH.</span></p>
