												        						<p><strong>Background</strong>: Lung cancer is the most common cancer type worldwide,&nbsp;with non-small cell lung cancer being the most frequently studied.&nbsp;Identifying of cancer-related genes in non-small cell lung cancer is crucial&nbsp;for developing individualized treatment, particularly as mutation&nbsp;profiles can vary by country and ethnicity.<br /><strong>Aims</strong>: To identify comprehensive mutation profiles in a cohort of&nbsp;Turkish patients with non-small cell lung cancer using the next-generation&nbsp;sequencing.<br /><strong>Study Design</strong>: Retrospective cross-sectional study.&nbsp;<br /><strong>Methods</strong>: In total, 72 cancer-related genes and 4149 variants were&nbsp;recorded in the non-small cell lung cancer panel, and their relationship&nbsp;with clinical and histopathological features was investigated through&nbsp;next-generation sequencing.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: Among 507 patients, 420 (82.8%) were males and 87 (17.2%)&nbsp;were females. Percentages of phosp hatid ylino sitol -4,5- bisph ospha te&nbsp;3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (11%), B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (8%), and neurofibromatosis type 1 (6%) mutations&nbsp;were higher than those reported in the literature. Males had a higher rate&nbsp;of Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog mutations (P = .102),&nbsp;whereas epidermal growth factor receptor mutations were statistically&nbsp;more common in females (P = .001). Multiple variants of strong significance&nbsp;were identified in 6.3% patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma,&nbsp;most of whom were smokers. Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene&nbsp;homolog and phosp hatid ylino sitol -4,5- bisph ospha te 3-kinase catalytic&nbsp;subunit alpha mutations were most commonly observed.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study shows that Turkish patients have higher rates&nbsp;of PIK3CA, BRAF and NF1 mutations compared to the literature.&nbsp;Studies to determine the molecular profile specific to Turkish people&nbsp;will guide clinicians in treatment and contribute significantly to determining&nbsp;priorities in diagnosis.</p>												        					</div>
