<p>
	Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Turkey and one of the most predictive risk factors of coronary disease in Turkish population is the ratio of total/HDL cholesterol. Therefore, adequate treatment of dyslipidemia, particularly with statins is very important with regard to prevention of coronary heart disease. However, lipid-lowering therapy is implemented suboptimally in Turkey. There is much to do for both patients and physicians.</p>
