Less than 1% of the cases suffer breast involvement. There are about 33 cases involving breast in the literature. In many cases, systemic symptoms mask breast involvement of sarcoidosis, that was generally recognized in result of surgical operation for malignancy. Breast and skin involvement together is rather rare in sarcoidosis. A 49-yearold female patient with mediastinoscopic diagnosis of sarcoidosis has been followed since 1999. Patient was treated with systemic corticosteroid twice due to skin involvement of sarcoidosis in 2002 and 2004. In 2006 macronodular lesions were found in both of her breast. Nodule excision and reduction mammoplasty were performed with pathological result of noncaseous granulomatous sarcoid inflammation. Patient was admitted as pulmonary sarcoidosis stage II with skin and breast involvement. Since lung, breast and skin involvement together is very rare in sarcoidosis we presented this case.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
