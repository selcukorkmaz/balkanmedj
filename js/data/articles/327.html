	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Euphrasia officinalis L. is an herb traditionally used in folk medicine, mainly in the treatment of eye disorders.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The present study analyzed the activity of three extracts of E. officinalis L. (ethanol, ethyl acetate and heptane) on cultured human corneal epithelial cells (10.014 pRSV-T).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: In vitro study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Toxicity, free radical scavenging activity and the immunomodulatory effects of the extracts were tested using the thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) or Neutral Red, 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ELISA tests, respectively. Moreover, nitric oxide levels and cytoskeleton architecture were analyzed after corneal cell incubation with the plant extracts.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: We show that the biological effect depended on both the concentration and the extraction solvent used. Heptane extracts, distinct from those in ethanol and ethyl acetate, were toxic to 10.014 pRSV-T cells at low concentrations (25 &mu;g/mL) and did not demonstrate free radical scavenging effects. All tested extracts decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-1&beta;, IL-6 and TNF-&alpha;) and also anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression by human corneal cells when the extracts were added to the cell culture medium for 24 h.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In conclusion, we show that the promising effects of the application of E. officinalis L. preparations as a supplementary therapy for eye disorders are associated with the ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts, not the heptane extract.&nbsp;</p>												        					</div>
