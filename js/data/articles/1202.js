Patients having cottage cheese-like discharge, vaginal pH&lt;4.5, Whiff test (-) were accepted as mycotic vaginitis. To determine mycotic agents in vaginal discharge, samples were cultured in Sabouraud glucose agar. As a treatment, patients were administered a single-dose of 300 mg sertaconazole nitrate ovule. Its clinical and microbiological aspects have been evaluated in the first visit, a week after and finally one month after the first visit. Symptoms related to vaginitis, clinical and microbiological recovery rates and adverse effects have been noted.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: All symptom scores were significantly lower in the second visit, and all except dysuria complaint in the third visit. Clinical recovery rates in the second and third visit were in 76.0% and 79.5%. According to mycotic culture test results, the microbiologic recovery rates were 88.8% in the second and 91.4% in the third visits.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Single-dose sertaconazole nitrate ovule was evaluated as a convenient, symptom-relieving and safe treatment for mycotic vaginitis.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
