	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Scleredema is a rare connective tissue disorder that belongs to a group of scleroderma-like disorders. Although no known curative therapy exists, various specific treatments have been proposed in the literature. In this report, we describe five cases of scleredema partially treated with low-dose methotrexate therapy. All patients have diabetes mellitus type II. All patients were started on methotrexate 15 mg subcutaneously once weekly for 3 months. Biopsy specimens were taken from all patients and were examinated histologically before the treatment and after 3 months of treatment. All cases partially responded to low-dose methotrexate therapy. We believe that methotrexate therapy may be an alternative therapeutic options in scleredema in view of its efficacy.</p>
