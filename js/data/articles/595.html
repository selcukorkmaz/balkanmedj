	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Cognitive deterioration has negative effects on the duration of a patient&#39;s hospital stay. Pre-recognition of patients&#39; cogitive characterictics affects treatment success. We want to put forward the cognitive profiles of inpatients.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: One hundred-six hospitalized patients over 50 years of age were assessed between 01-15 February 2009. Patients, not coooperative because of loss of consciousness and those who stayed in hospital because of primary cognitive disorder, have been excluded from study. At first evaluation, patients having cognitive deterioration hav2e been re-evalued at a dementia clinic and the patients&#39;cognitive profile identified. Groups with or without cognitive deterioration were compared for demographic properties.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Fifty-seven (%53.7) of 106 patients took 24, under 24 score from MMSE. 30 patients (28.3%) of 106 had mild cognitive deficiency. 8 patients (7.5%) had primary dementia syndrome. When groups with and without cognitive deterioration were examined, there was no difference in gender and family history (p=0.48, p=0.58). The mean age of the group with cognitive deterioration was higher, but lower educational level (p=0.008, p=0.006). MMSE scores were orderly 18.7&plusmn;2.3, 25.5&plusmn;2.2 (p&lt;0.001). Interestingly, complaints of forgetfulness were higher than normal in the patients (33%, 67%). 71% of patients believed that forgetfullness is not a disease and could not be treated.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cognitive failure are seen more frequently in inpatients. Relatives, responsible for the patient and medical staff are not aware of failure.</p>
