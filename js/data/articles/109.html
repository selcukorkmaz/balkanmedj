	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Background</strong>: Only 15 cases of Ewing&rsquo;s Sarcoma (EWS) family of tumors of urinary bladder have been documented in the literature to date.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: We presented here a 38 year-old female with primary urinary bladder EWS with no distant metastases. She had presented with macroscopic hematuria and had undergone transurethral resection of the tumor within the following week. Microscopic examination revealed a tumor diffusely infiltrating the lamina propria and muscularis propria under an intact urothelium, which was composed of small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm, monotonous round or oval nuclei, stippled chromatin and small nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry showed strong vimentin, synaptophysin and membranous CD99 expression by the tumor. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis displayed the EWSR1 rearrangement. Radical cystectomy with total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, extended lymph node dissection, and ileal conduit were performed. As adjuvant chemotherapy, she received vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and mesna, alternating with courses of etoposide, iphosphamide and mesna. She is alive and well with no evidence of disease 14 months after the surgery.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Surgery supported with chemotherapy should be considered as an option, especially in advanced Ewing&rsquo;s sarcoma family of tumors of urinary bladder.</p>
