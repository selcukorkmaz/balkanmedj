	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Background</strong>: The cardiovascular benefits of Resveratrol (RVT) have been well established by previous experimental and clinical studies.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Aims</strong>: The goal of this study was to test the effectiveness of RVT administration on the impaired endothelial function induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and to elucidate the role of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) pathway.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Study&nbsp;Design</strong>: Animal experiment.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Endotoxemia was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 10&thinsp;mg/kg LPS, and the thoracic aorta was isolated six hours later. RVT was injected intraperitoneally 15 minutes before LPS administration. Six hours after LPS injection, potassium chloride (KCl), phenylephrine (Phe), acetylcholine (ACh), and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were used to examine to vascular reactivity and endothelial function. eNOS, phospho-eNOS (p-eNOS) (Ser 1177), and SIRT1 expressions in thoracic aorta were evaluated by Western blot.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Results</strong>: LPS administration significantly inhibited the relaxation response induced by ACh, while the relaxation to SNP was not significantly altered. Phe- and KCl-induced contractile responses in the thoracic aorta significantly decreased in LPS-injected group. eNOS and p-eNOS expression decreased significantly in arteries obtained from LPS group rats. The impaired vasoreactivity as well as decreased expressions of eNOS, p-eNOS, and SIRT1 in vessels from LPS-injected rats were improved by RVT treatment. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of the thoracic aorta was significantly inhibited by LPS administration, and RVT treatment may improve vascular endothelial function. The protective effect of RVT might be associated with increased eNOS expression and activity.</p>
