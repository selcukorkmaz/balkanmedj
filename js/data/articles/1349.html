<p>
	Primary lung lymphomas represent less than 1% of all non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphomas, and most of these are MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphomas that originate from bronchial mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. In this report, we presented two cases of primary lung MALT lymphoma whose diagnoses were made by bronchospy and histopathological examination. Initial diagnoses were postobstructive pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotherapy in one patient, and lung carcinoma with persistent cough in the other.</p>
