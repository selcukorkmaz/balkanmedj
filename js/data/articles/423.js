For the first intervention group, the sacral region was massaged every hour 10-15 minutes after cesarean delivery and every 30 minutes after a voiding sensation for the second intervention group. No interventions were made in the control group, although routine hospital services were provided. Socio-demographic data were collected using a questionnaire developed by the researchers. Other data were collected via observation.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Fifteen percent (15%) of the women in the first intervention group needed to void 2 hours after cesarean delivery, 35% after 3 hours, and the mean time to void after delivery was 3.4&plusmn;0.8 hours. Forty percent (40%) of the women in the second intervention group needed to void after 5 hours, and the mean time to void after delivery was 5.5&plusmn;0.8 hours. Sixty percent (60%) of the women in the control group needed to void 6 hours later, and the mean time to void after delivery was 6.2&plusmn;0.7 hours. Urinary retention was not observed in the first intervention group. Our statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the three groups in terms of mean times to void after cesarean delivery (p&lt;0.05).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In order to facilitate voiding and to prevent urinary retention, which is seen as a post-cesarean complication, massaging the sacral region could be recommended instead of urinary catheter insertion. Additional studies with larger groups are also recommended.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
