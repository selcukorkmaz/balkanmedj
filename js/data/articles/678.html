	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Ureteral triplication is a rare congenital anomaly of the urinary tract. Since its first description, only about 100 cases have been reported in the literature. The association of ureteral triplication and contralateral duplication is even rarer. We reported a case of ureteral triplication and contralateral duplication with vesicoureteral reflux. The patient was a five-year-old girl with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, dysuria and lower abdominal pain. Intravenous Pyelography (IVP) showed duplication of the right ureter and triplication of the left ureter. In the cystourethrogram there was vesicoureteral reflux at the lower pole of the right kidney. The patient underwent right lower to upper ureteroureterostomy and excision of the distal ureter. This is the second report of ureteral triplication in Turkey. The literature concerning this rare anomaly was reviewed.</p>
