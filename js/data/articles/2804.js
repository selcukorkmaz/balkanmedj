The disease results from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and periarticular tissues, triggered by sustained hyperuricemia, defined as serum urate levels exceeding 6.8 mg/dL. While the pathophysiology of gout is well characterized at the molecular level, the disease burden is not uniformly distributed across populations, with substantial disparities observed along socioeconomic, racial, and geographic lines.</p>\n<p>Social determinants of health (SDOH) encompass the conditions in which individuals are born, grow, live, work, and age, and include factors such as education, income, employment, food security, housing stability, and access to healthcare. Mounting evidence indicates that SDOH are powerful predictors of health outcomes across a wide range of chronic diseases, often exerting effects that rival or exceed those of traditional clinical risk factors. In the context of gout and hyperuricemia, socioeconomic disadvantage may influence disease outcomes through multiple pathways, including limited access to urate-lowering therapy, dietary patterns associated with lower income, inadequate health literacy, and reduced engagement with preventive care.</p>\n<p>Despite the recognized importance of SDOH in chronic disease management, their impact on mortality outcomes in patients with gout and hyperuricemia remains insufficiently characterized. Previous studies examining mortality risk in gout have primarily focused on clinical and biochemical predictors, with limited attention to the socioeconomic context in which patients live. Moreover, the interaction between socioeconomic status and age in determining mortality risk has not been systematically explored, though emerging evidence suggests that socioeconomic deprivation may exert differential effects across the lifespan.</p>\n<p>The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) provides a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between SDOH and mortality in a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. By linking NHANES survey data with the National Death Index, it is possible to assess long-term mortality outcomes in relation to a comprehensive set of socioeconomic indicators. In this study, we aimed to develop a composite SDOH score incorporating eight socioeconomic indicators and examine its association with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in adults with hyperuricemia and/or gout, with particular attention to age-stratified effects.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"methods\">\n<h3>Materials and Methods</h3>\n<p>This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data from ten consecutive two-year cycles spanning 1999 to 2018 were pooled to achieve adequate sample size and statistical power. NHANES employs a complex, multistage probability sampling design to obtain a representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population, with oversampling of certain demographic subgroups to ensure reliable estimates for minority populations. All participants provided written informed consent, and the survey protocols were approved by the NCHS Research Ethics Review Board.</p>\n<p>The study population comprised adults aged 20 years and older with hyperuricemia (serum urate >7.0 mg/dL in men or >6.0 mg/dL in women) and/or self-reported physician-diagnosed gout. Participants were excluded if they were missing serum urate measurements, had incomplete data on the SDOH indicators required for composite score construction, or lacked linked mortality follow-up data. After applying these criteria, a total of 6,560 eligible participants were included in the final analytic sample. Mortality outcomes were ascertained through probabilistic linkage of NHANES participant records with the National Death Index through December 31, 2019, providing a maximum follow-up period of 20 years.</p>\n<p>A composite SDOH score was developed using eight socioeconomic indicators assessed during the NHANES interview: educational attainment (less than high school, high school graduate, some college, or college graduate), family income-to-poverty ratio, employment status, health insurance coverage, food security status, marital status, household size, and self-reported access to routine healthcare. Each indicator was dichotomized based on established thresholds reflecting disadvantage (e.g., family income-to-poverty ratio below 1.3, education below high school level, current unemployment, no health insurance). Participants received one point for each indicator reflecting socioeconomic disadvantage, yielding a composite SDOH score ranging from 0 (no indicators of disadvantage) to 8 (maximum disadvantage). The score was subsequently categorized into tertiles representing low (0-2), moderate (3-4), and high (5-8) socioeconomic disadvantage for stratified analyses.</p>\n<p>The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] codes I00-I99) and cancer mortality (ICD-10 codes C00-C97). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between the composite SDOH score and mortality outcomes. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, serum urate level, estimated glomerular filtration rate, presence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease history, and use of urate-lowering therapy. The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated using Schoenfeld residuals. Age-stratified analyses were performed using a cutoff of 60 years, and interaction terms between the SDOH score and age category were tested. Restricted cubic spline analyses were used to assess potential nonlinear relationships between the composite SDOH score and mortality risk. All analyses incorporated NHANES survey weights to account for the complex sampling design, and variance estimation was performed using Taylor series linearization. Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.2.1 with the survey package.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"results\">\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>Among the 6,560 study participants, the mean age was 56.2 years (standard error [SE] 0.4), 58.3% were male, and the racial/ethnic distribution was 45.7% non-Hispanic White, 22.8% non-Hispanic Black, 20.1% Mexican American, and 11.4% other. The mean serum urate level was 7.8 mg/dL (SE 0.03), and 24.6% of participants reported a physician diagnosis of gout. The mean composite SDOH score was 2.8 (SE 0.05), with 42.1% classified as low disadvantage (score 0-2), 34.5% as moderate disadvantage (score 3-4), and 23.4% as high disadvantage (score 5-8). Participants with higher SDOH scores were more likely to be female, non-Hispanic Black, current smokers, physically inactive, and have higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. They also had lower mean serum albumin levels and were less likely to be receiving urate-lowering therapy.</p>\n<p>During a median follow-up of 8.7 years (interquartile range 4.3-13.6 years), a total of 1,284 deaths were recorded, including 478 cardiovascular deaths and 298 cancer deaths. The crude all-cause mortality rates per 1,000 person-years were 14.2, 22.7, and 35.1 for the low, moderate, and high SDOH disadvantage groups, respectively. In fully adjusted Cox regression models, each one-unit increase in the composite SDOH score was associated with a 12% increase in all-cause mortality risk (HR 1.12; 95% CI 1.07-1.17; p < 0.001). Compared with the low disadvantage group, participants in the moderate and high disadvantage groups had adjusted HRs of 1.28 (95% CI 1.09-1.50; p = 0.003) and 1.67 (95% CI 1.38-2.02; p < 0.001) for all-cause mortality, respectively, demonstrating a significant dose-response relationship (p for trend < 0.001).</p>\n<p>For cardiovascular mortality, the adjusted HRs were 1.35 (95% CI 1.05-1.73; p = 0.019) for the moderate disadvantage group and 1.82 (95% CI 1.36-2.43; p < 0.001) for the high disadvantage group, relative to the low disadvantage group. For cancer mortality, the associations were weaker and did not reach statistical significance after full adjustment (HR 1.18; 95% CI 0.87-1.60; p = 0.29 for high versus low disadvantage). Restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed a monotonic, approximately linear relationship between the continuous SDOH score and all-cause mortality risk, without evidence of a threshold effect.</p>\n<p>Age-stratified analyses revealed a significant interaction between the SDOH score and age category for all-cause mortality (p for interaction = 0.008). Among participants younger than 60 years, the association between high SDOH disadvantage and all-cause mortality was substantially stronger (HR 2.31; 95% CI 1.68-3.17; p < 0.001) compared with participants aged 60 years and older (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.10-1.74; p = 0.006). A similar pattern was observed for cardiovascular mortality, where the HR for high versus low disadvantage was 2.74 (95% CI 1.62-4.63; p < 0.001) in the younger group and 1.45 (95% CI 1.02-2.05; p = 0.038) in the older group. Among the individual SDOH components, lack of health insurance (HR 1.54; 95% CI 1.28-1.85), food insecurity (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.17-1.70), and low educational attainment (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.16-1.64) emerged as the strongest independent predictors of all-cause mortality in the overall sample.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"discussion\">\n<h3>Discussion</h3>\n<p>This nationally representative study demonstrates that social determinants of health, as captured by a composite score of eight socioeconomic indicators, are significantly and independently associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in U.S. adults with hyperuricemia and/or gout. The observed dose-response relationship between increasing socioeconomic disadvantage and mortality risk persisted after comprehensive adjustment for clinical, biochemical, and behavioral confounders, suggesting that socioeconomic factors exert effects on mortality that are not fully explained by traditional risk factors. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating SDOH assessment into the comprehensive management of patients with gout and hyperuricemia.</p>\n<p>The finding that the association between SDOH and mortality is substantially stronger in younger adults (under 60 years) compared with older adults is a novel and clinically important observation. Several mechanisms may explain this differential effect. First, socioeconomic disadvantage in younger individuals may represent a more extreme deviation from age-normative expectations, reflecting deeper structural barriers to health. Second, younger adults may be more vulnerable to the cumulative effects of socioeconomic deprivation, as they have had fewer opportunities to accumulate wealth, establish stable employment, and build social support networks. Third, the competing risks of age-related comorbidities in older adults may attenuate the relative contribution of socioeconomic factors to mortality. These findings suggest that targeted interventions addressing socioeconomic barriers in younger adults with gout may yield particularly large reductions in mortality risk.</p>\n<p>Among the individual SDOH components, lack of health insurance emerged as the strongest independent predictor of mortality, consistent with extensive prior literature documenting the adverse health consequences of uninsurance. In the context of gout, uninsured patients are less likely to receive appropriate urate-lowering therapy, less likely to achieve target serum urate levels, and more likely to experience acute gout flares and complications. Food insecurity was the second strongest predictor, which is particularly relevant for gout, as dietary factors play a direct role in purine metabolism and serum urate regulation. Food-insecure individuals have limited ability to adopt the dietary modifications recommended for gout management, including reduced consumption of red meat, organ meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages, and increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products.</p>\n<p>Our findings must be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, the observational design precludes causal inference, and residual confounding by unmeasured variables cannot be excluded. Second, the SDOH indicators were assessed at baseline and may not capture changes in socioeconomic status over the follow-up period. Third, the composite SDOH score assigns equal weight to each indicator, which may not accurately reflect the relative importance of different socioeconomic factors for mortality risk. Fourth, the diagnosis of gout relied on self-report rather than crystal-confirmed diagnosis, which may introduce misclassification bias. Fifth, information on medication adherence and quality of gout management was not available, limiting our ability to assess the extent to which treatment-related factors mediate the observed associations.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, this study provides robust evidence that socioeconomic disadvantage, as measured by a composite SDOH score, is a significant and independent predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in adults with gout and hyperuricemia, with particularly strong effects observed in younger individuals. These findings highlight the need for healthcare systems to systematically screen for and address social determinants of health in patients with gout, and to develop targeted interventions that mitigate the adverse effects of socioeconomic deprivation on disease outcomes. Future research should examine the longitudinal dynamics of SDOH in gout populations and evaluate the effectiveness of social needs interventions in reducing mortality disparities.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol class=\"references-list\">\n<li>Chen-Xu M, Yokose C, Rai SK, Pillinger MH, Choi HK.
