The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between MPV and the subtypes of acute ischemic stroke.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Patients and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: The patient group consisted of 102 acute ischemic stroke patients who were divided into the large vessel (n=43) and the small vessel (n=59) disease subgroups. Their MPV values were compared with those of 48 age/sex-matched healthy individuals. The relationship of MPV with the subtypes and severity of stroke, and other hematological parameters (platelet count, platecrit, hemoglobin, hematocrit, erythrocyte count, mean corpuscular volume, leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte) was further investigated.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: No difference was found in terms of MPV values between the patient subgroups and control group, and no relation was found between MPV and stroke severity and other hematological parameters (p&gt;0.05). A significant increase in the leukocyte and neutrophil count was seen in patients of the large vessel disease group when compared with the small vessel disease and control group (p&lt;0.005). Neutrophil count is found to be a risk factor for the stroke severity (&beta;=0.362, p=0.01, OR=1.437, CI %95 0.02-0.08).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: No significant change in MPV was seen in acute ischemic stroke. High leukocyte and neutrophil levels are markers for the large vessel disease subtype and severity of ischemic stroke.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
