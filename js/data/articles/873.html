	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Iron deficiency is often seen in pregnancy. However, the prevalence of iron deficiency in this group shows both national and regional differences. This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of iron deficiency in pregnant women living in the Van region.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: We evaluated 700 pregnant women who were grouped according to age, duration of pregnancy and number of births. Iron deficiency was regarded as ferritin levels of &lt;12 &mu;g/L.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Median ferritin levels of all pregnant women were 27.04&plusmn;1.18 &mu;g/L (range: 1.5-248 &mu;g/L). Iron deficiency was observed in 40% of cases. Median ferritin levels were 35.69&plusmn;2.42, 30.40&plusmn;2.47 and 18.74&plusmn;1.34 &mu;g/L in the first, second and third trimester, respectively. Rates of iron deficiency according to trimesters were 26%, 33.5% and 53% respectively.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Ferritin levels were significantly low in pregnant women over 25 years of age, in those who had more than three pregnancy and in those who were over five months pregnant.</p>
