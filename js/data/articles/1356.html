	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: In this double blind, prospective and randomized study, the effects of the enteral administration of a prebiotic preparation containing oligofructose and inulin on upper gastrointestinal colonization and systemic inflammation in intensive care patients with severe sepsis were investigated.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: A total of 50 patients admitted to an intensive care unit were randomized to receive either prebiotic (group 1, n=25) or placebo preparations (group 2, n=25). The prebiotic preparation consisted of prebiotic fiber inulin-oligofructose (0.8 g/100 mL, A, D3, E vitamins). Gut barrier function was assessed by culture of nasogastric aspirate on the first and eighth days. All septic complications, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, ventilation days, gastrointestinal culture results, biochemical parameters, C-reactive protein (CRP) and mortality ratios were recorded.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: There were no differences between the groups in terms of age, sex, APACHE II scores, CRP, ventilation days. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of gastrointestinal culture, septic complications or mortality.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The administration of prebiotic solution in intensive care patients with severe sepsis had no effect on gastrointestinal permeability, gastric colonisation, the systemic inflammatory response and morbidity.</p>
