	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Background</strong>: Late preterm infants have increased rates of morbidity and mortality compared to term infants. Determining the risk factors in these infants leads to more comprehensive preventive and treatment strategies.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Aims</strong>: Our aim was to analyse the morbidity rates such as respiratory system diseases, infections, congenital anomalies, hypoglycemia and hematologic abnormalities and mortality rates in a large group of patients at a referral center.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Study&nbsp;Design</strong>: Retrospective cross-sectional study.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Medical records of late preterm and term infants who were managed at the referral center were analysed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Results</strong>: 41752 births were analysed in 3 years. 71.9% of all births were between 37-42 gestational weeks (i.e. term) and 16.1% were between 34-37 weeks (i.e. late preterm). Compared to term infants, late preterm infants had increased rates of short-term problems. The rate of mortality increased with decreased gestational age. The duration of hospitalization was significantly higher in the smallest late preterm infants.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study demonstrated the need that late preterm infants who have higher risk for morbidity and mortality, compared to term infants require close monitoring. The rate of mortality and hospitalization increased with decreased gestational age.</p>
