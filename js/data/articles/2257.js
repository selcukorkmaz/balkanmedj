There are several studies on the metabolism; however, not more studies were found in the literature on acute toxicity.<br /><strong>Aims:</strong> To report the acute toxicity of 5-MeO-MiPT in mice, followed by quantitative toxicological analysis of blood and organs, hystotoxicological and immunohistochemical analysis of tissues and cells.<br /><strong>Study design:</strong> Animal experiment<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> In vivo experiments were performed using CD1 adult female mice (n=26). Animals were caged in 4 groups randomly. First group was a control (n=3). Second group was vehicle control (n=3) and injected 150 &mu;L of blank solution (50% dimethyl sulfoxide in saline /0.9% of NaCl). While for acute toxicity experiments, 5-MeO-MiPT was added to a blank solution in order to obtain a dose of 0.27 mg/kg in 150 &mu;L injection (n=10) and the last group were injected 2.7 mg/kg 5-MeO-MiPT in a 150 &mu;L injection (n=10). Quantitative toxicological analysis, hystotoxicological and immunohistochemical analysis were performed.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> In the toxicological analysis, 5-MeO-MiPT was found negative in biological samples which were control, vehicle control, and 0.27 mg/kg dose mice groups. 5-MeO-MiPT was found 2.7-13.4 ng/mL in blood, 11-29 ng/g in kidney, 15.2-108.3 ng/g in liver, and 1.5-40.6 ng/g in the brain in 2,7 mg/kg injected group. In a low dose of the 5-MeO-MiPT liver section, compared with normal tissues, the difference in staining was statistically significant (p&lt;0.0001). In high-dose of 5-MeO-MiPT, H-score showed that the increase in the number of Caspase-3 positive cells was significant compared to the control (p&lt;0.05). In high-dose of 5-MeO-MiPT, intense Caspase-3 immunoreactivity was observed and the increase in the number of Caspase-3 positive cells compared to the control was statistically significant (p&lt;0.05). In brain section, the statistics of the results obtained from the H-score showed that the increase in the number of Caspase-3 positive cells was significant compared to the control (p=0.0183). In vehicle control liver section, there were few Caspase-8 positive cells characterized by a light brown appearance (p=0.0117). In the high-dose 5-MeO-MiPT group, the numbers of positive cells at low and high doses of 5-MeO-MiPT group were statistically significant compared to the control (p&lt;0.05). In the high-dose 5-MeO-MiPT group, Caspase-8 immunoreactivity was detected in the glomerular structures. Compared to control, the increase in Caspase-8 immunoreactivity was found to be statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Low-dose 5-MeO-MiPT did not cause any serious histopathological effects on the liver, kidney, and brain. High doses induce apoptotic cell death through caspase activity.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
