	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Eucalyptus belongs to the Myrtles family and its homeland is Australia and Tazmania. It is very easy to grow this tree, and some species can reach heights over 60-70 meters. As its roots widely spread, large quantities of water can be absorbed, which is of great help in drying swaps, particularly in malaria-struck countries; hence the name, malaria tree. In addition, eucalyptus oil together with menthol is used as an ingredient of pastilles to relieve cold-related complaints. Eucalyptus was first imported from Europe to Turkey during the Ottoman empire. Attempts were made to grow this tree for the drying of swaps and prevention of malaria in Edirne, where malaria had been a serious problem. People were enlightened about the benefits of Eucalyptus via articles published in an official newspaper of the city.</p>
