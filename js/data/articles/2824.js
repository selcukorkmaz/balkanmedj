Bone marrow adipocytes secrete adipokines, fatty acids, and inflammatory mediators that can be co-opted by leukemia cells to support their metabolic demands and resist chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.<sup>13,14</sup> Furthermore, the interaction between adipocytes and leukemia cells has been shown to activate pro-survival signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT and STAT3, thereby conferring chemoresistance.<sup>15</sup></p>\n  <p>This study investigated the hypothesis that FTO-mediated adipogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs creates a protective microenvironment that promotes chemotherapy resistance in AML. We examined the expression of FTO in BM-MSCs from AML patients, assessed its role in driving adipogenic differentiation, and evaluated the impact of FTO-modulated BM-MSCs on leukemia cell chemosensitivity using both in vitro co-culture systems and in vivo models.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"methods\">\n  <h3>Materials and Methods</h3>\n  <p><strong>Patient Samples and Cell Lines.</strong> Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 32 newly diagnosed AML patients (non-M3 subtypes) and 15 healthy donors at the Department of Hematology between March 2021 and September 2023. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (protocol no. 2020-HEM-047), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. AML diagnosis and classification were established according to the 2022 WHO classification criteria.<sup>16</sup> The human AML cell lines HL-60, KG-1, and MV4-11 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 &mu;g/mL streptomycin at 37 &deg;C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>\n  <p><strong>BM-MSC Isolation and Characterization.</strong> BM-MSCs were isolated from bone marrow aspirates by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) and subsequent plastic adherence culture. Cells were expanded in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS. BM-MSCs at passages 3-5 were used for all experiments. Characterization was performed according to the International Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) criteria, including flow cytometric analysis of surface markers (positive for CD73, CD90, CD105; negative for CD34, CD45, HLA-DR) and trilineage differentiation assays.<sup>17</sup></p>\n  <p><strong>FTO Expression Analysis.</strong> FTO mRNA expression was quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and complementary DNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara). qPCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara) on a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). GAPDH served as the endogenous control. FTO protein expression was assessed by western blot analysis using anti-FTO antibody (Abcam, ab124892, 1:1000) and anti-GAPDH antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, #5174, 1:5000). m6A RNA methylation levels were quantified using the EpiQuik m6A RNA Methylation Quantification Kit (Epigentek).</p>\n  <p><strong>Lentiviral Transduction.</strong> For FTO overexpression, the human FTO coding sequence was cloned into the pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 vector. For FTO knockdown, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting FTO (shFTO-1: 5'-GCAGCTGAAATACCCTAAACT-3'; shFTO-2: 5'-GCTGAAATACCCTAAACTGAT-3') and a non-targeting control (shNC) were cloned into the pLKO.1 vector. Lentiviral particles were produced in HEK293T cells using the second-generation packaging system (psPAX2 and pMD2.G). BM-MSCs were transduced at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 and selected with puromycin (2 &mu;g/mL) for 7 days.</p>\n  <p><strong>Adipogenic Differentiation.</strong> BM-MSCs were induced to undergo adipogenic differentiation using the StemPro Adipogenesis Differentiation Kit (Gibco) for 14 days. Lipid accumulation was assessed by Oil Red O staining and quantified spectrophotometrically at 510 nm following isopropanol extraction. Expression of adipogenic markers (PPAR&gamma;, C/EBP&alpha;, FABP4, and adiponectin) was assessed by RT-qPCR and western blot at days 0, 7, and 14 of differentiation.</p>\n  <p><strong>Co-culture Experiments and Chemosensitivity Assays.</strong> AML cell lines were co-cultured with BM-MSC-derived adipocytes (or undifferentiated BM-MSCs as controls) using both direct contact and Transwell (0.4 &mu;m pore size; Corning) systems for 48 hours. Following co-culture, AML cells were treated with cytarabine (Ara-C; 0.5-10 &mu;M) or daunorubicin (0.05-1 &mu;M) for 48 hours. Cell viability was assessed by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining and flow cytometry. IC<sub>50</sub> values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 9.0.</p>\n  <p><strong>Lipidomic Analysis.</strong> To investigate lipid transfer from adipocytes to leukemia cells, BM-MSC-derived adipocytes were labeled with BODIPY 493/503 (Invitrogen) and co-cultured with AML cells for 24 hours. Lipid transfer was visualized by confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 880) and quantified by flow cytometry. Additionally, free fatty acid content in co-cultured AML cells was measured using a Free Fatty Acid Quantitation Kit (Sigma-Aldrich).</p>\n  <p><strong>RNA Sequencing and m6A-seq.</strong> Total RNA from FTO-overexpressing and control BM-MSCs undergoing adipogenic differentiation (day 7) was subjected to RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq). Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 platform (paired-end, 150 bp). Differential gene expression analysis was performed using DESeq2, with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 and absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold change >1 as significance thresholds.</p>\n  <p><strong>In Vivo Studies.</strong> Female NOD/SCID/IL2R&gamma;<sup>null</sup> (NSG) mice (6-8 weeks old) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol no. IACUC-2022-0198). For the xenograft model, 1 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> MV4-11 cells were co-injected with 5 &times; 10<sup>5</sup> BM-MSC-derived adipocytes (FTO-overexpressing or control) into the tail vein. Mice received Ara-C (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, days 8-12 post-injection) or vehicle. Disease progression was monitored by peripheral blood analysis, bioluminescence imaging, and survival analysis.</p>\n  <p><strong>Statistical Analysis.</strong> Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 and R (version 4.2.0). Comparisons between two groups were performed using Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple group comparisons were conducted using one-way ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. All experiments were performed in triplicate unless otherwise specified, and results are expressed as mean &plusmn; standard error of the mean (SEM). A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"results\">\n  <h3>Results</h3>\n  <p><strong>FTO is Overexpressed in BM-MSCs from AML Patients.</strong> RT-qPCR analysis revealed that FTO mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in BM-MSCs isolated from AML patients compared to healthy donors (2.87 &plusmn; 0.34 vs. 1.00 &plusmn; 0.18 relative expression; p < 0.001). Western blot analysis confirmed elevated FTO protein levels in AML-derived BM-MSCs, with a mean 2.4-fold increase relative to control BM-MSCs (p < 0.01). Correspondingly, global m6A RNA methylation levels were significantly reduced in AML-derived BM-MSCs (0.68 &plusmn; 0.09% vs. 1.12 &plusmn; 0.14% of total adenosine; p < 0.01), consistent with enhanced FTO demethylase activity.</p>\n  <p><strong>FTO Promotes Adipogenic Differentiation of BM-MSCs.</strong> FTO-overexpressing BM-MSCs exhibited markedly enhanced adipogenic differentiation compared to control cells. Oil Red O staining at day 14 demonstrated a 3.2-fold increase in lipid accumulation in FTO-overexpressing BM-MSCs (optical density: 1.84 &plusmn; 0.22 vs. 0.58 &plusmn; 0.11; p < 0.001). Expression of adipogenic transcription factors and markers was significantly upregulated: PPAR&gamma; (4.1-fold, p < 0.001), C/EBP&alpha; (3.6-fold, p < 0.001), FABP4 (5.8-fold, p < 0.001), and adiponectin (3.9-fold, p < 0.001). Conversely, FTO knockdown (shFTO-1 and shFTO-2) substantially inhibited adipogenic differentiation, reducing Oil Red O staining by 62% and 58%, respectively (both p < 0.01). These effects were specific to adipogenesis, as FTO modulation did not significantly affect osteogenic differentiation capacity (p = 0.342).</p>\n  <p><strong>MeRIP-seq Identifies PPAR&gamma; as a Key FTO Target.</strong> MeRIP-seq analysis identified 1,847 differentially methylated m6A peaks between FTO-overexpressing and control BM-MSCs during adipogenic differentiation. Among these, 1,203 peaks showed decreased m6A methylation (hypomethylated) and 644 showed increased methylation (hypermethylated) in FTO-overexpressing cells. Integrated analysis with RNA-seq data revealed that PPAR&gamma; mRNA harbored significantly reduced m6A modification at its 3'-UTR (fold enrichment: 0.31 vs. 1.0; p < 0.001), which correlated with increased PPAR&gamma; mRNA stability (half-life: 8.4 hours vs. 4.2 hours; p < 0.01) and protein expression. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay confirmed direct binding of FTO to PPAR&gamma; mRNA, and m6A-specific site mutation at the 3'-UTR abolished the FTO-mediated stabilization effect. Additional FTO targets identified in the adipogenic pathway included CEBPB, KLF15, and DGAT2.</p>\n  <p><strong>FTO-Driven Adipocytes Promote Chemoresistance in AML Cells.</strong> Co-culture of AML cell lines with FTO-overexpressing BM-MSC-derived adipocytes significantly reduced chemosensitivity compared to co-culture with control adipocytes or undifferentiated BM-MSCs. The IC<sub>50</sub> of Ara-C for HL-60 cells increased from 1.24 &plusmn; 0.18 &mu;M (alone) to 2.87 &plusmn; 0.31 &mu;M (co-culture with control adipocytes) and 5.63 &plusmn; 0.47 &mu;M (co-culture with FTO-overexpressing adipocytes; p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed for KG-1 and MV4-11 cells and for daunorubicin treatment. Annexin V staining demonstrated that co-culture with FTO-overexpressing adipocytes reduced Ara-C-induced apoptosis by 48.7% in HL-60 cells (p < 0.001) and by 52.3% in MV4-11 cells (p < 0.001) compared to the monoculture condition.</p>\n  <p><strong>Lipid Transfer Mediates the Protective Effect.</strong> Confocal microscopy revealed efficient transfer of BODIPY-labeled lipids from BM-MSC-derived adipocytes to AML cells within 24 hours of co-culture. FTO-overexpressing adipocytes transferred significantly more lipids than control adipocytes, as quantified by flow cytometry (mean fluorescence intensity: 2,847 &plusmn; 312 vs. 1,456 &plusmn; 198; p < 0.001). Free fatty acid content was elevated 2.8-fold in AML cells co-cultured with FTO-overexpressing adipocytes compared to monoculture (p < 0.001). Treatment with the fatty acid oxidation inhibitor etomoxir (40 &mu;M) partially reversed the chemoresistance conferred by adipocyte co-culture, reducing the IC<sub>50</sub> of Ara-C in HL-60 cells from 5.63 &mu;M to 2.94 &mu;M (p < 0.01), suggesting that fatty acid metabolism contributes to the protective mechanism. Additionally, western blot analysis demonstrated increased phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and STAT3 (Tyr705) in AML cells co-cultured with FTO-overexpressing adipocytes, both of which were attenuated by etomoxir treatment.</p>\n  <p><strong>FTO-Modulated BM-MSCs Promote Chemoresistance In Vivo.</strong> In the NSG xenograft model, mice co-injected with MV4-11 cells and FTO-overexpressing BM-MSC-derived adipocytes exhibited significantly accelerated disease progression compared to the control adipocyte group. Bioluminescence imaging at day 14 revealed a 3.7-fold higher tumor burden in the FTO-overexpressing group (p < 0.001). Peripheral blood analysis demonstrated higher leukemia cell engraftment in the FTO-overexpressing group (18.4 &plusmn; 3.2% vs. 8.7 &plusmn; 2.1% human CD45<sup>+</sup> cells; p < 0.01). Importantly, Ara-C treatment reduced leukemia burden by 71.3% in the control group but only by 34.8% in the FTO-overexpressing group (p < 0.001). Median survival was significantly shorter in the FTO-overexpressing adipocyte group compared to the control adipocyte group (28 days vs. 42 days; hazard ratio: 2.84; 95% CI: 1.47-5.49; p = 0.002). FTO knockdown in BM-MSCs reversed these effects, with the shFTO group showing enhanced Ara-C sensitivity and prolonged survival comparable to the healthy donor BM-MSC group.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"discussion\">\n  <h3>Discussion</h3>\n  <p>This study provides compelling evidence that FTO-mediated adipogenic differentiation of BM-MSCs constitutes a previously unrecognized mechanism of chemotherapy resistance in AML. Our findings demonstrate that FTO is overexpressed in AML-derived BM-MSCs, promotes their adipogenic differentiation through m6A-dependent stabilization of PPAR&gamma; mRNA, and generates a lipid-rich microenvironment that shields leukemia cells from cytotoxic agents through lipid transfer and activation of pro-survival signaling pathways.</p>\n  <p>The observation that FTO is upregulated in BM-MSCs from AML patients extends the previously described role of FTO in leukemia cells themselves.<sup>12</sup> While Li et al. demonstrated that FTO promotes leukemogenesis through cell-autonomous mechanisms in AML blasts, our data reveal a complementary, non-cell-autonomous role whereby FTO in the stromal compartment reshapes the bone marrow microenvironment to favor leukemia cell survival. This dual function of FTO in both leukemia cells and their microenvironment underscores its potential as a therapeutic target in AML.<sup>18</sup></p>\n  <p>The mechanistic link between FTO and adipogenic differentiation through PPAR&gamma; mRNA stabilization is consistent with the known function of m6A modifications in regulating mRNA fate. m6A marks on the 3'-UTR typically recruit YTHDF2, a reader protein that promotes mRNA degradation.<sup>19</sup> By demethylating m6A residues on PPAR&gamma; mRNA, FTO prevents YTHDF2-mediated decay, thereby increasing PPAR&gamma; protein abundance and driving adipogenic commitment. This mechanism is supported by the observation that site-directed mutation of the m6A site in PPAR&gamma; 3'-UTR abolished the FTO-mediated stabilization effect, and is consistent with previous reports of FTO-mediated regulation of adipogenesis in non-hematopoietic contexts.<sup>20</sup></p>\n  <p>The identification of lipid transfer as a mediator of adipocyte-induced chemoresistance aligns with the emerging understanding of metabolic symbiosis between adipocytes and cancer cells.<sup>21</sup> In our model, FTO-driven adipocytes transferred fatty acids to AML cells, which were subsequently utilized through fatty acid oxidation to fuel mitochondrial respiration and resist apoptosis. The partial reversal of chemoresistance by the fatty acid oxidation inhibitor etomoxir supports this mechanism and suggests that metabolic intervention may complement conventional chemotherapy. Similar observations have been reported in ovarian cancer, where omental adipocytes promote tumor cell homing and growth through lipid transfer, and in prostate cancer, where periprostatic adipocytes support tumor progression through fatty acid provision.<sup>22,23</sup></p>\n  <p>The activation of AKT and STAT3 signaling in AML cells co-cultured with FTO-overexpressing adipocytes suggests that lipid-mediated signaling amplifies pro-survival cascades. Both AKT and STAT3 are well-established mediators of chemoresistance in AML, and their activation by the adipocyte-rich microenvironment provides a targetable vulnerability.<sup>24</sup> The combination of FTO inhibitors with AKT or STAT3 pathway inhibitors may represent a promising therapeutic strategy, although this requires further investigation.</p>\n  <p>Our in vivo findings using the NSG xenograft model provide strong translational evidence for the clinical relevance of FTO-mediated adipocyte-leukemia interactions. The significantly reduced response to Ara-C and shortened survival in mice bearing FTO-overexpressing adipocytes recapitulate the clinical observation that patients with adipocyte-rich bone marrow often exhibit inferior treatment outcomes.<sup>25</sup> These results support the development of therapeutic strategies targeting the FTO-adipocyte-leukemia axis.</p>\n  <p>Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, BM-MSC behavior in ex vivo culture may not fully recapitulate in vivo conditions. Second, the heterogeneity of AML subtypes was not exhaustively explored, and the contribution of FTO-mediated adipogenesis may vary across different genetic subtypes. Third, the NSG mouse model lacks a functional immune system, precluding assessment of immune-mediated effects. Fourth, the clinical translation of FTO inhibitors requires careful consideration of potential off-target effects, given the widespread expression of FTO in normal tissues. Future studies should investigate the therapeutic efficacy of FTO inhibitors (such as FB23-2 or CS1/CS2) in immunocompetent AML models and evaluate their safety profile in combination with standard chemotherapy.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n  <h3>References</h3>\n  <ol class=\"references-list\">\n    <li>Döhner H, Weisdorf DJ, Bloomfield CD.
