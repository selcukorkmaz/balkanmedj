Patients received sugammadex (2.0 mg/kg iv) at the reappearance of the second twitch of the TOF as an agent for reversal of neuromuscular blockage at the end of surgery. &nbsp;Patients were extubated at the time of TOF &ge;0.9. The patients&rsquo; TOF responses were evaluated with regards to PORC in at the 5th minute and were followed up for one hour in the recovery room. Reintubation was applied for those patients who developed PORC and had peripheric oxygen saturation &lt;90% despite being given 6 L oxygen per min with a face mask.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The onset time of neuromuscular blocking agent and time from T2 to achieve TOF ratio 90% (the duration of sugammadex effect) or over were found to be longer in the middle-aged elderly group than in the young elderly group. A statistically significant relationship was found between age and the duration of TOF ratio to reach 0.9 in the same direction. The PORC incidence and rate of reintubation were found to be 1.7% in all patients.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In our opinion, it is necessary to remember that the duration of sugammadex effect on the recovery period is prolonged for patients who are aged &ge;75 years compared to patients aged between 65-74 years.
