	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Pityriasis rosea is an acute inflamatory skin disease that the etiology is unknown but some viral agents like human herpes virus-6 and 7 and drugs are suspected.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case report</strong>: A-58-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C was being followed up in our hospital. Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) alfa-2b (100 &micro;g per week) and ribavirin (1000 mg/day) was started. In the third month of this treatment, the patient was diagnosed with pityriasis rosea (PR), which was confirmed by skin biopsy. PEG-IFN alfa-2b treatment for chronic hepatitis C was maintained and no therapy was given for PR. The lesions spontaneously improved within 5 weeks.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Interferon and ribavirin have several cutaneous side effects. Our case is the first case of PR, emerged in a patient with chronic hepatitis C while receiving PEG-IFN alfa 2b and ribavirin.</p>
