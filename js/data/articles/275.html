	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: Hamartoma of the larynx is a very rare lesion, and the number of reported cases is limited. Signs and symptoms include stridor, changes in voice, eating and respiratory complaints. Stridor is a sign of upper airway obstruction. Patients presenting with stridor and severe respiratory distress necessitate urgent otolaryngologic evaluation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Case Report</strong>: Herein, we report a case of laryngeal hamartoma presenting with recurrent pneumonia and persistent stridor in a 7-month-old patient. He was admitted to hospital with the initial diagnosis of recurrent pneumonia and persistent stridor. Stridor was not responsive to cool mist, nebulised epinephrine or dexamethasone. Cervical computed tomography (CT) revealed a solid, nodular mass on the posterolateral wall of larynx. The mass was excised surgically. After surgical removal of the hamartoma, the child was relieved of the obstruction.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We want to emphasise that patients presenting with persistent stridor and severe distress necessitate urgent otolaryngologic evaluation.</p>												        					</div>
