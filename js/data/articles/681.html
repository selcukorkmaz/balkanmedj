	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of the study is to analyze the general aspects of cases with carbon monoxide intoxication in order to improve the approach to future patients.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: The hospital records of 84 children (mean age 4.71&plusmn;2.64 years; 48 male, 36 female) who had been admitted to Paediatric Emergency Department for carbon monoxide intoxication between October 2007 and February 2009, were retrospectively evaluated in a descriptive analysis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The source of carbon monoxide intoxication was heaters, waterheaters and fi re in 82.1%, 7.1% and 6% of cases, respectively. There was a statistically signifi cant difference between the carboxyhemoglobin levels of the patients according to the clinical classifi cation (p&lt;0.05). The intoxication caused by heaters was observed signifi cantly in November, December and January (p&lt;0.001), between 16:00-24:00 hours (p&lt;0.001) and among more than one member of a family (p&lt;0.001). A medium level correlation was detected between the treatment approach and clinical classifi cation (r=0.50, p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Carbon monoxide intoxication, in the presented series, was found to develop accidentally; mostly in the Winter season; during night hours when the family members gathered together. The carboxyhemoglobin levels were appropriate with the developing clinical findings. Carboxyhemoglobin level solely was not enough for achieving the diagnosis and planning the treatment.</p>
