The authors reported that febuxostat treatment was associated with improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction, serum uric acid levels, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations over a 12-month follow-up period. While we commend the authors for addressing an important and clinically relevant question, we wish to raise several methodological considerations and highlight issues regarding the differential effects of febuxostat in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) versus heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) that merit further discussion.</p>\n<p>First, the study enrolled a heterogeneous population comprising both HFpEF and HFrEF patients without pre-specified stratification or adequate subgroup analysis. This is a critical limitation, as the pathophysiology, natural history, and treatment responses of these two entities are fundamentally distinct.<sup>2</sup> In HFrEF, oxidative stress and xanthine oxidase (XO) activity are closely linked to myocardial remodeling, neurohormonal activation, and progressive ventricular dysfunction.<sup>3</sup> XO inhibition by febuxostat may therefore exert cardioprotective effects through direct reduction of reactive oxygen species generation in the failing myocardium. In contrast, the pathophysiology of HFpEF is driven predominantly by systemic microvascular inflammation, cardiometabolic dysfunction, and diastolic impairment, processes in which the role of XO activity and uric acid is less clearly defined.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>Second, the EXACT-HF trial, which randomized 253 patients with symptomatic HFrEF and elevated uric acid to allopurinol versus placebo, failed to demonstrate clinical benefit of XO inhibition despite significant reductions in serum uric acid.<sup>5</sup> This raises the question of whether uric acid lowering per se is the mechanism of benefit or whether febuxostat exerts heart failure-specific effects independent of uric acid reduction. Notably, febuxostat has been shown to possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that are distinct from those of allopurinol, including superior endothelial function improvement and more potent suppression of vascular oxidative stress.<sup>6</sup> The authors' study would benefit from exploring whether the observed clinical improvements correlated with markers of oxidative stress or inflammation rather than uric acid reduction alone.</p>\n<p>Third, we note that the study used echocardiographic parameters as surrogate endpoints. While changes in ejection fraction and diastolic function indices are informative, hard clinical outcomes such as heart failure hospitalization, cardiovascular mortality, and composite endpoints are necessary to establish the clinical utility of febuxostat in this population. The ongoing randomized controlled trials evaluating febuxostat in heart failure, including the FREED-HF trial, will provide more robust evidence in this regard.<sup>7</sup></p>\n<p>Finally, the potential cardiovascular safety concerns associated with febuxostat, raised by the CARES trial demonstrating higher cardiovascular mortality compared to allopurinol in patients with gout, cannot be overlooked when considering long-term use in heart failure patients who are inherently at elevated cardiovascular risk.<sup>8</sup> While the FAST trial subsequently provided more reassuring data, the safety profile of febuxostat in the specific context of heart failure requires dedicated evaluation.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while the findings of Ke et al. are promising, we believe that properly powered, randomized controlled trials with pre-specified HFpEF and HFrEF subgroups and hard clinical endpoints are essential before febuxostat can be recommended as an adjunctive therapy in heart failure with hyperuricemia.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol class=\"references-list\">\n<li>Ke L, Zhang M, Wang H, et al.
