	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Background</strong>: There are insufficient data in the literature on the presence of Helicobacter pylori in tonsil and adenoid tissue of patients with only airway obstruction. This study examined the presence of H. pylori in surgical cases with airway obstruction or recurrent infection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Aims</strong>: To investigate the relationship between H. pylori adenotonsillar colonisation and the frequency of adenotonsillitis and to compare paediatric and adult patients according to H. pylori tonsillar colonisation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Prospective clinical trial.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Methods</strong>: Patients scheduled for adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy were classified into three groups based on indications: paediatric infection (n=29), paediatric obstruction (n=29) and adult infection (n=12). Tissue samples obtained from patients were examined for the presence of H. pylori by culture, rapid urease test and polymerase chain reaction.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Forty-nine tonsil tissues were examined. Positive results were found in two specimens with the rapid urease test (4.1%) and three with polymerase chain reaction examination (6.1%). Only three positive polymerase chain reaction results (5.8%) were identified in 52 adenoid tissue samples. There were no statistically significant differences in the presence of H. pylori between paediatric infection and obstruction groups or between paediatric infection and adult infection groups.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In our study, there was a low incidence of H. pylori colonisation in tonsil and adenoid tissues. Regarding H. pylori colonisation, there was no significant difference between paediatric infection and obstruction groups. Also, no significant difference was found between adult and paediatric cases.</p>
