We aimed to compare the efficacy of CTrach&trade; (CT) and Direct Coupled Interface-Videolaryngoscope (DCI-VL) in patients with normal airways.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Sixty ASA I&ndash;II (American Society of Anesthesiologists) adult patients admitted for elective surgery were enrolled in this prospective study. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups, where intubation was performed via CT or DCI-VL. Time to obtain a good glottic view, total intubation time, success rates and the number of patients who required maneuvers for a good glottic view were recorded.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The mean time to obtaining a good glottic view was significantly longer with CT than with DCI-VL (29.4&plusmn;20.3 seconds vs. 12.8&plusmn;1.9 seconds, respectively; p=0.01). Intubation was achieved on the first attempt in 28 patients in the CT group (93.3%) and in 24 in the DCI-VL group (80%) (p=0.77). The total intubation time for CT was significantly longer compared to DCI-VL (99.9&plusmn;36.0 seconds vs. 39.2&plusmn;21.4 seconds, respectively; p=0.01). Optimization maneuvers were required in eight and two patients in the CT and DCI-VL groups, respectively (p=0.03).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although the normal airway endotracheal intubation success rates were similar in both groups, the time to obtain a good glottic view and the total intubation time were significantly shorter with DCI-VL.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
