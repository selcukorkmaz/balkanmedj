<p>
	Aplastic anemia in pregnancy is a rare condition with high maternal morbidity and mortality rates. Intensive hematological support during antenatal course remains the mainstay of the therapy. A successful obstetric outcome can be best accomplished with the clinical collaboration of the obstetrician and the hematologist. We present a patient with moderately severe aplastic anemia who was managed with intensive hematological support given repeatedly once in a month during pregnancy. She delivered a healthy infant by cesarean section.</p>
