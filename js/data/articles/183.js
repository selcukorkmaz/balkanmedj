H1 antihistamines reduce the symptoms of rhinitis, but some compounds may have anti-inflammatory properties.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: We evaluated the plasma level of some cytokines in patients with persistent allergic rhinitis (PAR) and their evolution after a 4-week treatment with H1 antihistamines, as well as the risk of asthma after 1.5 years.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Randomized clinical trial.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: Eighty-five patients with PAR and 30 healthy volunteers were included in the study. The patients with PAR were randomly divided into 2 groups: 41 patients treated with 5 mg/day desloratadine and 44 patients under 5 mg/day levocetirizine for 4 weeks. The clinical and biological evaluations were performed before and after treatment and included rhinitis symptoms and total symptoms score, type of sensitization, and plasmatic levels of total IgE, IL-1&beta;, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-&alpha;.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: IL-8 and TNF-&alpha; were significantly increased in patients with PAR compared to healthy volunteers (5.85 vs 3.12, p&lt;0.001 and 2.32 vs 1.06, p&lt;0.001, respectively). Both H1 antihistamines reduce all symptoms of allergic rhinitis, including nasal congestion and the plasmatic level of IL-1&beta;, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-&alpha;, after 4 weeks of treatment. The reduction of cytokine levels was not influenced by patients&rsquo; age, sex, duration or severity of rhinitis, or type of sensitization. Levocetirizine has a superior effect compared to desloratadine in reducing the rhinitis symptoms and cytokines&rsquo; level. Twenty eight (32.9%) of the patients presented asthma symptoms after 1.5 years. The occurrence of asthma was influenced by house dust sensitization (OR-14.6; CI 95% 1.8-116.3; p=0.01), but baseline values of cytokines were not predictive factors for its appearance.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Levocetirizine and desloratadine as a prolonged therapy reduce plasmatic levels of some pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients with PAR. Levocetirizine has a better effect on decreasing the symptoms and plasmatic levels of IL-1&beta; and IL-8.
