In this study, it is intended to investigate and discuss the data of the eastern region of Turkey which is trailing in health care indicators.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: In this cross-sectional study, the health data gathered through periodical field studies in the Erzurum Health Field during 2002-2008 are compared.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: In the region, compared to year 2002 data, a 44% increase in general practitioner number and 65% increase in supporting medical personnel number have been achieved. Compared to year 2002 data, application to the health organisation has increased from 1.9 to 4.5 (33% to primary level and 67% to secondary level). The referrals from local health clinics to hospitals have been reduced from 20.2% to 2.7%. In the region in general, recording of birth ratio is 87% and recording of pregnancy ratio is 70%. DBT-1 vaccination ratio is 90%. Tuberculosis ratio is 14 per hundred thousand. Health care services have improved in the cities of the region. Referral ratios to secondary level frequency is still high. Even though the number of personnel is increased, it is observed that, to reach the set targets, starting with innoculation, the primary level health care services will take time.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Family medicine practice is promising for the integration of services, institution of referral chain system and improvement of health level indicators.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
