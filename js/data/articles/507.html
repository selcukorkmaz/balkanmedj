	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of this study was to analyze the midterm clinical results of aortic valve replacement with cryopreserved homografts.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Materials and Methods</strong>: Aortic valve replacement was performed in 40 patients with cryopreserved homograft. The indications were aortic valve endocarditis in 20 patients (50%), truncus arteriosus in 6 patients (15%), and re-stenosis or regurtitation after aortic valve reconstruction in 14 (35%) patients. The valve sizes ranged from 10 to 27mm. A full root replacement technique was used for homograft replacement in all patients.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 12.5% (5 patients). There were four late deaths. Only one of them was related to cardiac events. Overall mortality was 22.5%. Thirty-three patients were followed up for 67&plusmn;26 months. Two patients needed reoperation due to aortic aneurysm caused by endocarditis. The mean transvalvular gradient significantly decreased after valve replacement (p&lt;0.003). The last follow up showed that the 27 (82%) patients had a normal left ventricular function.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Cryopreserved homografts are safe alternatives to mechanical valves that can be used when there are proper indications. Although it has a high perioperative mortality rate, cryopreserved homograft implantation is an alternative for valve replacement, particularly in younger patients and for complex surgical problems such as endocarditis that must be minimalized.</p>
