	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	Solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) is a rare neoplasm which most frequently occurs in the pleura, especially visceral pleura, but it is known that intrapulmonary SFT is very rare. We report the case of a 60-year-old woman who was admitted with a 6-year history of slow enhancing intrapulmonary nodular lesion in her right upper lobe on chest computed tomography (CT). A right upper lobectomy was performed for complete excision of the tumour and the postoperative histopathological examination revealed SFT. No pathology was observed during the period of 34-month postoperative follow-up. Herein we present an extremely rare case of intrapulmonary SFT that was located in the deep pulmonary parenchyma.</p>
