	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: To assess the outcomes of the Limited Urethral Mobilization (LUM) technique in distal hypospadias repair.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: Forty-seven patients, who were operated on with the LUM technique iduring a 6 years period, were grouped according to their ages. Age distribution in Group 1 (n=37) and Group 2 (n=10) were 6-36 and 37-72 months. Meatal localization was glanular in 31, coronal in 7 and sub-coronal in 9 patients. Nine patients were secondary cases. The urethra proximal to the meatus was mobilized for a distance sufficient to allow it to reach the glans tip without tension. Then, the urethra was placed in the glanular bed and glanular reconstruction was performed. Operation duration, distance between the urethral meatus and the glans tip; and urethral mobilization length were measured and post-operative complications were noted.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Operation durations were similar in both groups. Three-fold urethral mobilization was sufficient for construction of tension-free urethra-glanular anastomosis. No fistula or retraction of the urethral meatus and chordee were observed. One patient required meatotomy.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Distal hypospadias repair with the LUM technique is simple and effective. As no new urethral tube is constructed there is no risk of fistula. A slit-like urethral meatus with good functional results was obtained with the use of theLUM technique.</p>
