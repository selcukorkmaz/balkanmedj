	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Anatomical dimensions of lateral ulnar collateral and annular ligaments were determined in the present study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: These measurements were performed on 20 elbows from 10 cadavers. Lateral ulnar collateral and annular ligaments were dissected in all elbows and their anatomical lengths and widths were measured.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The mean length of the right annular ligament was 55.6 mm and the mean width was 12.6 mm. The mean length of the right lateral ulnar collateral ligament was 23.2 mm and the mean width was 13.6 mm. The mean length of the left annular ligament was 55.4 mm and the mean width was 11.5 mm. The mean length of the left lateral ulnar collateral ligament was 19.3 mm and the mean width was 12.1 mm.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Ruptures of lateral ulnar collateral and annular ligaments generally occur during elbow dislocations. The dimensions of these two ligaments are important since they determine the grafts to be chosen for their surgical repair. These dimensions are quite helpful for the surgeon who will perform the reconstruction for estimating the length and thickness of the graft to be used for this purpose. When the mean values obtained in the present study are taken into consideration, grafts of at least 10 cm in length, a value which is five folds greater than the ligaments&#39; lenght, are required for repairing the lateral ulnar collateral and annular ligaments. We believe that more reliable results can be obtained with series comprising higher numbers of cadavers.</p>
