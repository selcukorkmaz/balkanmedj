The patients were randomized to two groups. After sinus excision, 33 patients (group 1) underwent primary closure, and 15 patients (group 2) underwent Karydakis flap surgery. The mean followup was 6.8 months (range 4 to 11 months) in group 1, and 6.2 months (range 3 to 10 months) in group 2.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Serous liquid collection and discharge were seen at the site of the lesion in four patients (12.1%) in group 1, and in two patients (13.3%) in group 2. Subcutaneous hematoma was detected in one patient (6.7%) in group 2. During the follow-up period, none of the patients developed wound infection. Recurrences were seen in one patient (3%) in group 1, and in one patient (6.7%) in group 2.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Excision and primary closure can be the preferred method for the treatment of pilonidal sinus in selected patients due to its advantages such as ease and simplicity, shorter recovery time, and limited scar formation.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
