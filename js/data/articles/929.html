	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The importance of the Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) matching is well known in renal transplantation that is one of the best treatment options for end-stage solid organ deficiency. Human Leukocyte Antigens matching between recipient and donor has an influence on graft survey after the renal transplantation. However allogeneic renal transplants between HLA identical siblings might be ended with rejection. Minor histocompatibility antigen (mHag) HA-1 is a nine-amino acid peptide encoded by a diallelic gene on human chromosome 19. mHags have low polymorphisms. Minor histocompatibility antigens are likely to function as potantial risks for graft rejection of HLAmatched solid organ transplantation. In our study, we aimed to investigate the effect of minor HA-1 mismatch on kidney transplant survey.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: We examined the HA-1 locus in living donor renal transplant patients (n=59) and their donors. We used PCR-SSP for HA-1 typing.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: The frequencies of the three possible genotypes HH, RR, HR were 17%, 25% and 58%, respectively, in recipients. No significant correlation was established between the occurrence of rejection/rejection episodes and HA-1 matching (p=0.73, Or=1.44, Confidence intervals= 0.36-5.74; Fischer&rsquo;s Exact Test). In addition, no significant carrelation was established between CAN (chronic allograft nephropathy) and mHA-1 matching (p=0.61, Or=2.89, Confidence intervals=0.28-29.57; Fischer&rsquo;s Exact Test).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: We could not find relation between graft survey and HA-1 match/mismatch in living donor kidney transplantation.</span></p>
