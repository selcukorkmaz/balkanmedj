Human vaginal fibroblasts (HVFs) that maintain the integrity of vaginal wall tissues are essential for keeping pelvic organs in place. Apoptosis and the degradation of the extracellular matrix in HVFs contribute to the progression of POP. The cytokine signal transduction inhibitor 3 (<em>SOCS3</em>) exerts significant regulatory effects on cell signal transduction pathways, thereby affecting various pathological processes.<br /><strong>Aims:</strong> To explore the role and mechanism of <em>SOCS3</em> on HVFs in the context of POP.<br /><strong>Study Design:</strong> In vitro cell lines and human-sample study.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> Anterior vaginal wall tissues were obtained from POP or non-POP patients for the analysis of <em>SOCS3</em> expression. HVFs were isolated from the vaginal tissues of POP patients, and <em>SOCS3</em> was either overexpressed or knocked down in HVFs via lentivirus infection. Subsequently, the biological function and mechanism of <em>SOCS3</em> in HVFs were investigated.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> <em>SOCS3 </em>was highly expressed in the vaginal tissues of POP patients compared to non-POP patients. Functionally, the overexpression of <em>SOCS3</em> suppressed cell viability while promoting cell apoptosis in HVFs. The overexpression of <em>SOCS3</em> also accelerated extracellular matrix degradation (decreasing collagen I, collagen III, and elastin, and increasing <em>MMP2 </em>and <em>MMP9</em>). In terms of mechanism, <em>NR4A1</em> transcriptionally activated <em>SOCS3 </em>by binding to its promoter. Furthermore, rescue experiments revealed that <em>SOCS3</em> knockdown hindered <em>NR4A1</em> overexpression-induced cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation in HVFs.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> <em>SOCS3</em> mediated the apoptotic and extracellular matrix degradation effects of <em>NR4A1</em> on HVFs, underlining that the restraining of the <em>SOCS3</em> expression may be a promising strategy for POP treatment.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#methods\">Methods</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#results\">Results</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#discussion\">Discussion</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"introduction\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Introduction</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<hr size=\"1\" color=\"#f2f2f2\">\r\n<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>\r\n<p>Pelvic organ prolapse (POP), a common gynecological disease among females, is characterized by the protrusion of the pelvic organs (vagina, uterus, bladder, and/or rectum) into or out of the vaginal canal.<sup>1</sup> Treatment options for POP include pelvic floor muscle training, vaginal pessaries, and reconstructive pelvic surgery. However, the therapeutic outcomes are often unsatisfactory and relapse is a common occurrence.<sup>2,3</sup> Therefore, it is imperative to elucidate the pathogenesis of POP to develop effective treatments for this condition.</p>\r\n<p>The most common form of POP is anterior vaginal wall prolapse, commonly known as cystocele. In the vaginal wall, connective tissues provide the supportive strength for the pelvic floor.<sup>4</sup> The connective tissue layer consists of an extracellular matrix (ECM), which obtains its strength from collagen I, collagen III, and elastin.<sup>5</sup> Vaginal fibroblasts control ECM production and remodeling, by generating anabolic proteins, like collagens, and activating catabolic enzymes, such as matrix metalloproteinases (<em>MMPs</em>), thus modifying their surrounding matrix.<sup>6</sup> In patients with POP, fibroblast dysfunction leads to damaged collagen metabolism and an unbalanced disturbed ECM production.<sup>7,8</sup> Additionally, some studies have confirmed increased fibroblast apoptosis in POP.<sup>9</sup> However, there is a limited number of studies that focus on the underlying mechanism. Hence, enhancing the functions of fibroblasts emerges as a viable approach to impede the progression of POP.</p>\r\n<p>The cytokine signal transduction inhibitor 3 (<em>SOCS3</em>), one of the SOCS family proteins, interacts with various activated proteins of the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.<sup>10</sup> <em>SOCS3</em> suppresses cell proliferation and its deletion inhibits myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis.<sup>11,12</sup> Moreover, the downregulation of <em>SOCS3</em> promotes collagen release and aggravates fibrosis in murine models.<sup>13</sup> Database analysis showed an upregulation in <em>SOCS3</em> expression in the anterior vaginal wall tissue of patients with POP. Therefore, <em>SOCS3</em> may participate in the development of POP.</p>\r\n<p>Human nuclear receptor 4A 1 (<em>NR4A1</em>) is an orphan nuclear receptor associated with fibrosis of multiple organs. <em>NR4A1</em> limits fibrotic diseases by regulating transforming growth factor-b (<em>TGF-</em>b) signaling.<sup>14</sup> Hiwatashi et al.<sup>15</sup> reported that <em>NR4A1</em> inhibits vocal fold fibrosis, while <em>NR4A1 </em>knockdown promotes collagen I expression in fibroblasts. <em>NR4A1</em> also participates in the pathological progression of POP by promoting the apoptosis of fibroblasts.<sup>16</sup> Furthermore, 9-AA, an agonist of <em>NR4A1</em>, enhances the expression levels of <em>SOCS3</em>.<sup>17</sup> Based on these published results, we hypothesize that the <em>NR4A1</em>/<em>SOCS3</em> axis may play a role in the progression of POP.</p>\r\n<p>In this study, we investigated the function and mechanism of <em>SOCS3</em> in POP. We found that <em>SOCS3 </em>expression was higher in the vaginal tissues of POP patients than that in non-POP patients. <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression induced cell apoptosis and ECM degradation in human vaginal fibroblasts (HVFs) from patients with POP. Additionally, we detected that <em>SOCS3</em> was transcriptionally activated by <em>NR4A1</em>, and the effect of <em>SOCS3</em> on HVFs was regulated by <em>NR4A1</em>. This study provides evidence for the role of <em>SOCS3</em> in POP.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a><a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#methods\">Methods</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#results\">Results</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#discussion\">Discussion</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"methods\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Methods</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>MATERIALS AND METHODS</h3>\r\n<p><strong><em>Tissue samples collection</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Anterior vaginal wall tissues were collected from POP patients (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;36, age range: 47-74) and non-POP patients (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;18, age range: 39-57).

Cells were passaged and expanded until reaching 60% confluence, and those up to the fourth passage were used for subsequent experiments. Immunofluorescence was performed to identify cells at the fourth passage using markers for vimentin (a marker for fibroblasts), cytokeratin (a marker for epithelial cells), and desmin (a marker for smooth muscle cells).</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Lentivirus infection</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>The coding sequences of <em>SOCS3</em> or <em>NR4A1 </em>were inserted into pLVX-IRES-puro (Fenghbio, China) to generate <em>SOCS3 </em>overexpression lentivirus (LV-<em>SOCS3</em>) or <em>NR4A1</em> overexpression lentivirus (LV-<em>NR4A1</em>). The map of pLVX-IRES-puro is shown in Figure S2a. Additionally, <em>SOCS3</em>-targeted shRNA was inserted into pLVX-shRNA1 (Fenghbio, China) to establish sh<em>SOCS3 </em>lentivirus (LV-sh<em>SOCS3</em>). The map of pLVX-shRNA1 is shown in Figure S2b. The <em>SOCS3</em> shRNA sequence is as follows: 5&cent;-GCTTCGACTGCGTGCTCAAGC-3&cent;, LV-SOCS3, LV-NR4A1, LV-shSOCS3, and their negative controls (NC) were subsequently packaged in HEK293T cells. The lentiviral-containing supernatant was harvested and filtered.

Subsequently, GO enrichment analysis of differential expression genes (<em>DEGs</em>) revealed an association among POP, ECM, and cell apoptosis (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_0.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 1a</b></a>). In these <em>DEGs</em>, <em>SOCS3</em> knockdown inhibits cell apoptosis and promotes collagen release,<sup>12,13</sup> suggesting that <em>SOCS3</em> may be involved in the progression of POP. In addition to the GSE12852 dataset, the high expression of <em>SOCS3</em> in POP tissues was observed in the GSE53868 dataset (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_0.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 1b</b></a>). To verify our conjecture, we collected vaginal tissues from POP and non-POP patients. Then, Masson trichrome staining and TUNEL staining were performed to explore the histomorphological differences. The results of Masson trichrome staining showed decreased collagen (blue) in tissues of POP patients compared with non-POP patients (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_0.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 1c</b></a>). TUNEL staining revealed a higher incidence of apoptosis in tissues from POP patients (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_0.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 1d</b></a>). These results indicated more prominent collagen degradation and apoptosis in patients with POP, consistent with previous reports<sup>7</sup> and our bioinformatics analysis. To further investigate the role of <em>SOCS3</em> in POP, we detected <em>SOCS3</em> mRNA expression in vaginal tissues. The results showed that S<em>OCS3</em> was significantly upregulated in patients with POP (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_0.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 1e</b></a>). Western blot analysis further verified the upregulation of <em>SOCS3</em> at the protein level (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_0.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 1f</b></a>). Moreover, IHC and the histologic score (H-score) were performed to further verify the expression pattern of <em>SOCS3</em> in POP. The results showed higher <em>SOCS3</em> expression levels in the POP group compared with the non-POP group (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_0.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 1g-h</b></a>). Furthermore, we analyzed the association between the expression levels of <em>SOCS3</em> and patient characteristics in Table S1; however, no correlation was observed. These results suggested that <em>SOCS3</em> was upregulated in the vaginal tissues of patients with POP.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Morphological identification of HVFs</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Primary HVFs obtained from the vaginal tissues of POP patients were cultured and collected for microscopic observation (Figure S1a). Then, the fourth passage of HVFs was subjected to immunofluorescence staining to identify the phenotype using specific biomarkers (Figure S1b). The results revealed high cytoplasmic expression of vimentin (a marker of fibroblasts) in the fourth passage of HVFs. In contrast, no significant increase in the expression of cytokeratin (a marker of epithelial cells) and desmin (a marker of smooth muscle cells) was observed. The above results illustrated that cells isolated from vaginal tissues were mainly fibroblasts without the contamination of epithelial and smooth muscle cells.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SOCS3 overexpression inhibits viability and induces apoptosis in HVFs</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Considering the increased expression of <em>SOCS3</em> in POP, the function of <em>SOCS3</em> in POP was further investigated. <em>SOCS3</em> was overexpressed in the fourth passage of HVFs through lentivirus infection, and the gene overexpression was confirmed with RT-qPCR and western blot (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_1.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 2a, b</b></a>). Subsequently, the results from the CCK-8 assay showed that <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression inhibited the cell viability of HVFs (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_1.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 2c</b></a>). Additionally, a significantly higher apoptosis rate was observed in <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression groups compared to the control groups (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_1.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 2d</b></a>). The TUNEL assay further verified the above results, with more TUNEL-positive cells observed in <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression HVFs (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_1.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 2e</b></a>). In addition, pro-apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved-caspase-3, as well as anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, were detected by western blot. The expression levels of Bax and cleaved-caspase 3 increased, whereas that of Bcl-2 decreased, as observed after <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_1.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 2f, g</b></a>). These results suggested that <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression inhibited viability and induced apoptosis of HVFs.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SOCS3 overexpression induces ECM degradation in HVFs</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Previous experiments validated the significance of collagen degradation as a prominent characteristic in patients with POP.<sup>20</sup> Thus, to explore whether <em>SOCS3</em> participates in the regulation of ECM components, the protein expression of collagen I, collagen III, and elastin was analyzed. The results revealed that <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression reduced the expression of collagen I, collagen III, and elastin (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_2.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 3a</b></a>). Besides, we detected the protein expression of <em>MMP2</em> and <em>MMP9</em>. Collagen-degrading <em>MMPs</em> are involved in ECM remodeling processes, as shown in <a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_2.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 3b</b></a>, increased expression of <em>MMP2</em> and <em>MMP9</em> was observed after <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression. Moreover, the expression of components related to collagen synthesis pathways, including <em>TGF-</em>b, Smad2/3, and phosphorylated Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3) was detected.<sup>21</sup> We found that <em>TGF-</em>b<em>1</em> and p-Smad2/3 showed low expression in the <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression HVFs, and the expression of Smad2/3 was almost unchanged (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_2.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 3c, d</b></a>). Together, all the signs indicated that the upregulation of <em>SOCS3</em> caused ECM degradation in HVFs.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SOCS3 is transcriptionally activated by NR4A1 via binding the SOCS3 promoter</em></strong></p>\r\n<p><em>NR4A1</em> accelerates the pathological process of POP by inducing fibroblast apoptosis.<sup>16</sup> To investigate the relationship between <em>SOCS3</em> and <em>NR4A1</em>, we constructed <em>NR4A1</em>-overexpressing lentivirus (LV-<em>NR4A1</em>) to infect HVFs. A clear rise of <em>NR4A1</em> mRNA and protein expression was shown in HVFs (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_3.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 4a, b</b></a>). <em>NR4A1</em> overexpression was accompanied by increased <em>SOCS3</em> mRNA and protein levels (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_3.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 4c, d</b></a>), suggesting that <em>SOCS3</em> expression might be regulated by <em>NR4A1</em>. Based on the above results, we predicted <em>NR4A1</em>-binding sites on the <em>SOCS3</em> promoter (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_3.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 4e</b></a>), and the interaction between <em>NR4A1</em> and <em>SOCS3</em> was further confirmed by the dual luciferase reporter assay. As shown in <a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_3.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 4f</b></a>, when fragment A (-1948, -1585 bp, containing four sites) or fragment B (-1585, -643 bp, containing two sites) was truncated, the luciferase activity was decreased. Moreover, when there was only fragment C (-643 to +36, containing one site), the promoter activity was increased compared with the control vector. These results indicated that the regions from -1948 to -1585 bp, -1585, -643 bp, and -643 to +36 bp contained binding sites of <em>NR4A1</em>. The above results suggest that <em>NR4A1</em> transcriptionally activates <em>SOCS3</em> by binding to its promoter.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>NR4A1 overexpression induces cell apoptosis and ECM degradation in HVFs</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>To further verify the effects of <em>NR4A1</em> on POP, we assessed <em>NR4A1 </em>expression in vaginal tissues from POP and non-POP patients.

In addition, the protein expression levels of collagen I, collagen III, and elastin were attenuated in <em>NR4A1</em>-overexpression HVFs (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_4.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 5g</b></a>), indicating that <em>NR4A1</em> promoted ECM degradation.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>SOCS3 mediates the effect of NR4A1 on HVFs</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>To determine whether <em>SOCS3</em> mediates the effect of <em>NR4A1</em> on HVFs, HVFs were co-infected with <em>NR4A1</em> overexpression lentivirus and sh<em>SOCS3 </em>lentivirus. The results showed that <em>SOCS3</em> knockdown increased cell viability and decreased cell apoptosis in <em>NR4A1</em> overexpression HVFs (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_5.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 6a, b</b></a>).

Together, these results revealed that the function of <em>NR4A1</em> on HVFs was blocked via <em>SOCS3</em> knockdown, indicating that <em>NR4A1</em> affected HVFs by <em>SOCS3</em>-mediated apoptosis and ECM degradation in HVFs.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>The screening of potential genes regulated by SOCS3</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>RNA‐seq analysis was further performed to detect the possible mechanism of <em>SOCS3</em> on HVFs. Initially, principal component analysis exhibited significantly different component profiles between <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression (LV-<em>SOCS3</em>) and control (LV-NC) groups (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_6.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 7a</b></a>). <em>DEGs </em>were identified by volcano plot filtering (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_6.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 7b</b></a>). We identified 203 downregulated and 914 upregulated <em>DEGs</em>.

Anterior vaginal wall prolapse is the most common form of POP. Vaginal fibroblasts maintain the integrity of vaginal wall tissues, which is important for supporting pelvic organs and preventing POP.<sup>23</sup> Numerous studies have demonstrated that fibroblast apoptosis and ECM loss play critical roles in the progression of POP.<sup>7,8</sup> In our study, we selected vaginal tissues as experimental subjects to explore the pathogenesis of POP. As expected, the vaginal tissues showed decreased collagen deposition and enhanced apoptosis in patients with POP. Subsequently, through bioinformatics analysis, we observed an elevated expression of <em>SOCS3</em> in patients with POP, suggesting a potential association between <em>SOCS3</em> and the progression of POP.</p>\r\n<p><em>SOCS3</em>, as a member of the suppressor of the cytokine signaling family, is a potent inhibitor of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of the transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway.<sup>10</sup> <em>SOCS3</em> is implicated in various human diseases, including cancers, inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, asthma, and neuronal diseases.<sup>24</sup> However, thus far, these studies provide limited information on the relationship between <em>SOCS3</em> and POP, and the mechanism of action of POP remains unclear. In our study, we confirmed that <em>SOCS3</em> expression was higher in the vaginal tissues of patients with POP, suggesting that increased <em>SOCS3</em> expression may participate in the progression of POP. Recent studies have reported that <em>SOCS3 </em>inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis.<sup>11,12</sup> In our study, we also observed that <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression inhibited viability and induced apoptosis in HVFs. Additionally, collagen I, collagen III, and elastin are the main ingredients of ECM. The strength and resilience of vaginal tissues are determined by collagens and elastin, respectively.<sup>5</sup> Dees et al.<sup>13</sup> reported that the deletion of <em>SOCS3</em> promotes collagen release. In light of this finding, we sought to investigate whether <em>SOCS3</em> regulates the ECM in HVFs. Our results demonstrated that <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression led to decreased expression levels of collagen I, collagen III, and elastin. Moreover, <em>MMPs</em> are involved in the degradation of ECM and suppression of collagen deposition in POP.<sup>6</sup> Some studies have reported that <em>SOCS3</em> knockdown results in the downregulation of <em>MMP2</em> and <em>MMP9</em>.<sup>25</sup> Consistent with previous research, our study showed that upregulation of <em>SOCS3</em> elevated the expression of <em>MMP2</em> and <em>MMP9</em>. Besides, our studies further found that <em>SOCS3</em> also downregulated <em>TGF-</em>b<em>1</em> and p-Smad2/3 protein expression. <em>TGF-</em>b<em>1</em> is a crucial regulator in fibrosis-related diseases, which induces myofibroblast transformation and regulates ECM production.<sup>26</sup> It promotes ECM deposition by enhancing collagen synthesis and suppressing <em>MMPs</em>.<sup>27</sup> <em>TGF-</em>b1 exerts its diverse biological activities mainly through activating transcriptional regulators of the Smad pathway. The p-Smad2/3 produced upon <em>TGF-</em>b<em>1</em> activation is responsible for regulating collagen and fibronectin gene expression.<sup>28</sup> A previous study has reported that increased <em>SOCS3</em> expression inhibits <em>TGF-</em>b<em>1</em> expression.<sup>29</sup> <em>TGF-</em>b1 blocks the loss of ECM by suppressing <em>MMP2 </em>and <em>MMP9</em> expression via the <em>TGF</em>-b1/Smad3 signaling pathway in the uterosacral ligament of patients with POP.<sup>30</sup> Our findings revealed that <em>SOCS3</em> decreased the expression of p-Smad3 and p-Smad2. Therefore, we hypothesized that <em>SOCS3</em> may enhance the expression of <em>MMP2 </em>and <em>MMP9 </em>by inhibiting <em>TGF-</em>b<em>1</em>/Smad2/3, thereby promoting ECM degradation. Nevertheless, these possible mechanisms and detailed interactions among them require further exploration. In summary, <em>SOCS3</em> overexpression induced apoptosis and ECM degradation of HVFs.</p>\r\n<p>The abnormal expression of <em>SOCS3 </em>is often attributed to the transcriptional activation of its promoter. For example, the transcriptional activation of the farnesoid X receptor enhances <em>SOCS3</em> expression.<sup>31</sup> In this study, we confirmed that <em>NR4A1</em> overexpression enhanced the levels of <em>SOCS3</em>, and we identified the <em>NR4A1</em> binding sites on the <em>SOCS3</em> promoter. Thus, <em>SOCS3</em> might be transcriptionally regulated by <em>NR4A1</em>. <em>NR4A1</em>, belonging to the orphan nuclear hormone receptors of the Nur77 family, is a transcription factor involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis.<sup>32</sup> Similarly, Zeng et al.<sup>16</sup> demonstrated that <em>NR4A1</em> induces apoptosis by linking the actin cytoskeleton in parametrial ligament fibroblasts of POP. Here, we found that <em>NR4A1</em> was highly expressed in the vaginal tissues of POP patients. <em>NR4A1 </em>overexpression promoted cell apoptosis and ECM degradation in HVFs. More importantly, <em>SOCS3 </em>knockdown reversed the negative effects of <em>NR4A1</em> on HVFs, suggesting that <em>NR4A1</em> affected the function of HVFs by transcriptionally activating <em>SOCS3</em> (<a href=\"javascript:openWin('uploads/grafik/figure_BMJ_2571_7.jpg', 640, 480)\"><b>Figure 8</b></a>).</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the RNA-seq analysis was performed to investigate the potential downstream genes that may be regulated by <em>SOCS3</em>. When <em>SOCS3</em> was overexpressed, <em>DEGs </em>were significantly enriched in ECM organization, programmed cell death, and collagen catabolic process, which was consistent with our findings. <em>SOCS3 </em>overexpression upregulated the expression of various genes, such as <em>HTRA1 </em>and <em>CTSS</em>. The upregulated expression of <em>HTRA1</em> has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell apoptosis.<sup>33</sup> Additionally, reducing the expression of <em>CTSS</em> increases ECM deposition.<sup>34</sup> These downstream factors may play a role in the POP process. However, follow-up experiments are needed to further study the functions of these factors.</p>\r\n<p>The dysfunction of <em>SOCS3</em> may contribute to several disorders. The activation of <em>SOCS3</em> leads to insulin resistance and retinal endothelial cell apoptosis in the diabetic retina.<sup>35</sup> <em>SOCS3</em> deletion suppresses myocardial apoptosis, which results in the block of left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction.<sup>36</sup> Moreover, hepatocyte steatosis was accelerated by promoting <em>SOCS3</em> expression.<sup>37</sup> Selective inhibition of <em>SOCS3</em> may attenuate some of these consequences, suggesting the potential role of <em>SOCS3</em> inhibitors as a promising therapy for disease treatment. For example, PARg agonist ROZ alleviated steatosis by decreasing <em>SOCS3</em> expression.<sup>37</sup> Similarly, the inhibition of <em>SOCS3</em> expression by ruxolitinib attenuates atherosclerosis.<sup>38</sup> Besides, microRNAs have been identified as regulators of <em>SOCS3 </em>expression. Repression of microRNA-122 reduces <em>SOCS3 </em>expression by promoter methylation.<sup>39</sup> These methods of inhibiting <em>SOCS3</em> expression may offer new clinical avenues for the treatment of POP.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, we found no significant association between the expression of <em>SOCS3</em> or <em>NR4A1</em> and the characteristics of patients with POP. We speculated that this may be due to the insufficient number of samples. In the future, we will continue to collect clinical samples to clear the relationship between the expression levels of <em>SOCS3 </em>or <em>NR4A1</em> and the characteristics of patients with POP.</p>\r\n<p>In conclusion, this study provides evidence that <em>SOCS3</em>, transcriptionally activated by <em>NR4A1</em>, promotes the progression of POP by inducing HVF apoptosis and ECM degradation. Thus, the <em>NR4A1</em>/<em>SOCS3</em> axis emerges as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of POP.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ethics Committee Approval:</strong> This study was conducted following the Declaration of Helsinki, and approved by the Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University Ethics Committee (2022PS040K).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Data Sharing Statement:</strong> The datasets analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Authorship Contributions:</strong> Concept- Z.X.; Collection and Processing- X.J., Q.H., M.Q., Y.Y.; Analysis or Interpretation- X.J., Q.H.; Literature Search- X.J.; Writing- X.J., Z.X.; Supervision- Z.X.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conflict of Interest:</strong> The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Funding:</strong> This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province (under Grant 2021JH2/10300054).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Supplementary:</strong> <a href=\"https://balkanmedicaljournal.org/uploads/pdf/suplement_2023-10-60.pdf\">http://balkanmedicaljournal.org/uploads/pdf/suplement_2023-10-60.pdf</a></p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#methods\">Methods</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#results\">Results</a><a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#discussion\">Discussion</a><a class=\"menu\" href=\"#reference\">Reference</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t<div  style=\"width:100%; float:left;  padding-bottom:0px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:100%; float:left; min-height:45px; text-align:justify\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"\" name=\"reference\"></a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<!--<h2>Reference</h2>-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>REFERENCES</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Barber MD.
