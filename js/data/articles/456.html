	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: We aimed to evaluate uterine junctional zone thickness, cervical length and bioelectrical impedance analysis of body composition in women with endometriosis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: This is a prospective study conducted in a tertiary teaching hospital. A total of 73 patients were included in the study. Endometriosis was surgically diagnosed in 36 patients (study group). The control group included 37 patients. Main outcome measure(s): Bioelectrical impedance analysis was used to measure body composition. Uterine junctional zone thickness and cervical length were measured by transvaginal ultrasonography.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Patients&#39; characteristics (age, gravida, parity, live baby, age of menarche, lengths of menstrual cycle , percentage of patients with dysmenorrhea, positive family history), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), amount of body fat (kg), percentage of body fat were not statistically different between the two groups (p&gt;0.05). The length of menstruation and cervical length were longer in women with endometriosis. Similarly, the inner myometrium was thicker in women with endometriosis than the control group.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The relation between endometriosis and demographic features such as age, gravida, parity, gravida, BMI, lengths of the menstrual cycle, age of menarche are controversial. Longer cervical length and thicker inner myometrial layer may be important in the etiopathogenesis of endometriosis.</p>
