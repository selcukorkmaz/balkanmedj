She had a medical history of osteoporosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thoracolumbar spine radiography and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging revealed an acute compression fracture of the L1 vertebral body with approximately 40% loss of anterior vertebral height and no evidence of posterior wall involvement or spinal canal compromise. Given the severity of her pain and failure to respond to conservative measures including analgesics and a thoracolumbar brace over 4 weeks, percutaneous vertebroplasty was performed under fluoroscopic guidance.</p>\n<p>The procedure was technically successful, with injection of approximately 4.5 mL of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement into the L1 vertebral body via a bilateral transpedicular approach. Intraprocedural fluoroscopy demonstrated adequate cement distribution within the vertebral body; however, a small amount of cement extravasation was noted into the paravertebral venous plexus (Figure 1a). The patient reported immediate improvement in her back pain following the procedure.</p>\n<p>A routine postprocedural chest CT, performed 48 hours later to evaluate an incidentally noted opacity on chest radiography, revealed multiple high-density linear and tubular opacities within the segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries bilaterally, consistent with cement emboli (Figure 1b, 1c). The emboli were most prominent in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery branches. The patient was entirely asymptomatic from a respiratory standpoint, with no dyspnea, chest pain, or tachycardia. Oxygen saturation remained 97% on room air. Pulmonary function tests were within normal limits, and echocardiography showed no evidence of right ventricular strain or pulmonary hypertension.</p>\n<p>Given the asymptomatic nature of the cement emboli, the absence of hemodynamic compromise, and the peripheral distribution of the emboli, a conservative management approach with close clinical surveillance was adopted. Anticoagulation was not initiated, as the cement emboli are solid and non-thrombogenic, and there is no established evidence supporting anticoagulation in this setting. At the 6-month follow-up visit, the patient remained asymptomatic with stable cement emboli on repeat CT imaging and no development of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiographic surveillance.</p>\n<p>Pulmonary cement embolism is a recognized but frequently underdiagnosed complication of percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, with reported incidence rates ranging from 3.5% to 23% on postprocedural CT imaging. Cement leakage into the paravertebral venous plexus allows PMMA to travel through the azygos and hemiazygos venous system into the pulmonary vasculature. The majority of pulmonary cement emboli are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally; however, symptomatic cases can present with dyspnea, chest pain, and, rarely, fatal cardiopulmonary collapse. Risk factors include low cement viscosity at the time of injection, high injection pressures, large cement volumes, and the presence of cortical defects or intraosseous venous channels communicating with the paravertebral veins. This case serves as a reminder that not all pulmonary emboli are thrombotic in nature, and clinicians should be aware of this iatrogenic entity, particularly when interpreting CT pulmonary angiography in patients with a history of vertebral augmentation procedures.</p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"references\">\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol class=\"references-list\">\n<li>Krueger A, Bliemel C, Zettl R, Ruchholtz S.
