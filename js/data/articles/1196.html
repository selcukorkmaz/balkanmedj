	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: In this study, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allel frequencies of Thracian Turkish population were determined.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: The study group consisted of 105 tissue donors who live in Thrace region of Turkey for three generations and have similar linguistic features. Polymerase chain reaction-sequencespecific primer (PCR-SSP) method was used for genotyping of HLA-A, B and DRB1 alleles. The most frequent HLA alleles were HLA-A*02 (20.5%), HLA-B*35 (22.9%) and HLA-DR*11 (17.6%).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Conclusion: In this study also, HLA-DR allel frequencies were compared in order to determine the relationship between other Turkish populations and Balkan populations. It is observed that Thracian Turkish population has similar HLA-DR distributions with Balkan populations.</p>
