	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The aim of study is to introduce method of Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA), and to express whether the method is affected from the number of independent variables, the relationship between variables and sample size.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Simulation study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: SIMCA model is performed in two stages. In order to determine whether the method is influenced by the number of independent variables, the relationship between variables and sample size, simulations were done. Conditions in which sample sizes in both groups are equal, and where there are 30, 100 and 1000 samples; where the number of variables is 2, 3, 5, 10, 50 and 100; moreover where the relationship between variables are quite high, in medium level and quite low were mentioned.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Average classification accuracy of simulation results which were carried out 1000 times for each possible condition of trial plan were given as tables.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is seen that diagnostic accuracy results increase as the number of independent variables increase. SIMCA method is a method in which the relationship between variables are quite high, the number of independent variables are many in number and where there are outlier values in the data that can be used in conditions having outlier values.</p>
