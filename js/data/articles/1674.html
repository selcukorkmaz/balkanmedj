	<strong>Background:</strong> Angiokeratoma of fordyce occurring over on the vulva is a rare condition. Fordyce angiokeratoma is observed more frequently among men than women. In women, it is generally observed in later life, and appears as multiple dark purple papules, measuring 2-4 mm, on the vulva.<br />
	<strong>Case Report: </strong>We present the case of a 17-year-old white teenage girl with giant Fordyce angiokeratoma on the right vulva. The angiokeratoma was removed and a V-Y advancement flap was made.<br />
	<strong>Conclusion:</strong> In the literature, this is the first childhood case reported in which a reconstruction of the vulva was performed.</p>
