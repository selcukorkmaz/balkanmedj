Gender, age, accommodation place, educational level of the parents, school success, sharing problems with the parents, insistent behaviors of friends for smoking, and orbital scores were found to have significant effects on smoking. Gender, accommodation place, father&#39;s educational status, the number of friends taking alcohol, insistent behaviors of friends for taking alcohol, importance level of religion, and orbital scores were found to have significant effects on alcohol consumption.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The results of the study show that the FLPS is an applicable survey to determine the use of substance, and that orbital scores have an effect on cigarette and alcohol consumption.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
