	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The aim of the study is to measure the levels of antioxidant vitamins and magnesium during allergic rhinitis attacks.</p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: Thirty five children who have sensitivity for house dust and mite with mild/ moderate persistent allergic rhinitis without any other allergic diseases were considered as the study group, and 35 healthy children as the control group. The patient group was classified according to the symptom scoring system. Venous blood samples were obtained before breakfast in each group to determine serum vitamin A, C, E and magnesium levels.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Results</strong>: Serum vitamin A level was significantly lower in the study group compared with the control group. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of serum vitamin C, E and magnesium levels.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size: 12px;"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This study showed that vitamin A consumption increases to repair mucosal epithelium which is damaged by inflammation and to prevent the oxidative damage in allergic rhinitis. This result may imply new therapeutic approaches.</span></p>
