Saliva flow rate, buffer capacity and microorganism content are very important in the maintenance of oral health.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: We aimed to evaluate saliva flow rate, pH, buffer capacity and Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli content along with the decayed, missing, and filled tooth index in Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s patients.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Case-control study</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: Forty patients with active Beh&ccedil;et disease [female:male (F/M) 21/19, mean age 31.05&plusmn;11.08 years] and forty healthy persons (F/M 21/19, mean age 31.03&plusmn;9.14 years) were included in the study. The oral region was first examined, and the decayed, missing, and filled tooth index was calculated for each person. Stimulated saliva was collected and divided into two separate millimetric tubes to calculate the buffer capacity of the saliva, determine Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli levels and measure the pH of the saliva. A Caries Risk Test buffer strip was used to calculate the buffer capacity. Caries Risk Test bacterial kit was used to determine Streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli levels. A pH meter was used to measure the pH of the saliva.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The mean saliva pH of the patients was higher than the controls (7.76&plusmn;0.51, 7.18&plusmn;0.46, respectively) (p&lt;0.001). The mean level of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacilli in patients was higher than controls (p&lt;0.05). The mean decayed, missing, and filled tooth index of patients was 9.82&plusmn;6.59 (range 1-28), while the mean decayed, missing, and filled tooth index of the controls was 6.05&plusmn;3.35 (range 1-16) (p&lt;0.01). There were no significant differences between the patients and the controls with respect to saliva flow rate and saliva buffer capacity (p&gt;0.05).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We think that the maintenance of oral health by effective, regular tooth brushing, regular dental check-ups and dental treatment for Beh&ccedil;et patients is very important for the prevention and therapy of Beh&ccedil;et disease.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
