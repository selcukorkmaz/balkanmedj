Its shape and structure were macroscopically noted, and the AH was classified into four types. For determining the localization, measurements were made with digital calipers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Twenty-four oval fibrous types, 12 oval muscular types, 2 bridging fibrous types and 2 bridging muscular types of AH were determined. For the horizontal localization of AH, the apex of the AH was determined to be located medial to the vertical line between the midpoint of the interepicondylar distance and the line which was drawn transversely from the apex of the AH, in all of the cadavers. For the vertical one, the apex of the AH was located in the middle third of the femur length in 14 thighs, and in the remaining 26 ones, the apex of the AH was located in the distal third of the femur length.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Adductor hiatus was classified according to its shape and structure for the first time. Moreover, the localization of the AH was practically defined, in order not to harm the popliteal artery and vein.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
