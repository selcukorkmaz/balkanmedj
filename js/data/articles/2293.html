												        						<p>Antibiotic consumption rates were quite high in number, although the bacterial coinfection rates were low in coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia. Generally, empirical antibiotic treatment is not recommended for uncomplicated coronavirus disease 2019 mild to moderate pneumonia cases. On the other hand, antibiotic treatment and de-escalation are recommended for intubated intensive care unit patients or critical patients with sepsis, septic shock, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The presentation of patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia can direct the clinicians to use antibiotics. We believe that wait and watch strategy can be preferred in such cases without sepsis, secondary bacterial infection findings, or procalcitonin &lt; 0.5 ng/mL. We think that a new wave of resistance will occur inevitably if we cannot perform the antibiotic stewardship properly.</p>												        					</div>
