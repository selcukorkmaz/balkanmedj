Tamoxifen is used for breast cancer. In this study, we have aimed to investigate the effects of quercetin and tamoxifen on telomerase enzyme activity and apoptosis in two cell lines.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: In this study, 10, 50 and 100 &mu;M of quercetin and tamoxifen were used to treat MCF-7 and NIH-3T3. Apoptosis was determined by the TUNEL method (Terminal Deoxynucleotide Transferase dUTP Nick End Label) and telomerase enzyme activity was determined by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: In the NIH3T3 cell line, only 100 &mu;M quercetin and tamoxifen induced significant apoptosis. In the MCF-7 cell line 10 &mu;M and 100 &mu;M quercetin in the 24th hour and 100 &mu;M quercetin in the 72 hour induce apoptosis. In 24th and 48th hours, 50 &mu;M tamoxifen and 100 &mu;M tamoxifen in the 24th and 48th hours induce apoptosis in the MCF-7 cell line. In MCF-7 and NIH-3T3 cell lines, all doses of quercetin and tamoxifen reduced telomerase enzyme activity compared to the control group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: In this study, it was shown that quercetin has similar effects to tamoxifen. However quercetin induces apoptosis more than decreasing telomerase enzyme activities, being different from tamoxifen. We hope that the findings will assist in developing new therapeutic pathways for preventing breast cancer. However, there should be many more studies in order to discover quercetin and other potential drugs.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
