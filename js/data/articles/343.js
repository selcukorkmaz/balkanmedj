Vein and artery arrangements were documented.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: The most frequently encountered arrangement (41.5%) was a single vein and artery on both sides. Mean distances on the right and left sides were 4.01 and 4.47 cm at the umbilical level, 3.81 and 4.26 cm at the midlevel, and 5.62 and 5.51 cm at the origin level. On both sides, measurement differences between the three levels were highly significant (p&lt;0.05). In addition, a total of 56 IEA bifurcations were depicted in all 200 patients. Thirteen of the 56 bifurcations occurred only on the right side, 11 only on the left side, and 32 on both sides.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It is important to be attentive to the IEA&rsquo;s course, at different midline levels, when attempting percutaneous interventions via an abdominal approach.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
