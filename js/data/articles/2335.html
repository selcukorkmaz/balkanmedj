												        						<p><strong>Background</strong>: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex is an autosomal dominant&nbsp;multi-system disorder with an incidence of about 1 in 6000 live births.&nbsp;Defects in either TSC1 (* 605284) or TSC2 (* 191092) genes encoding&nbsp;the components of the Tuberous Sclerosis&nbsp;Complex are responsible for&nbsp;the disease. Therefore, consideration of TSC1/TSC2 pathogenic variations&nbsp;is recommended in the updated diagnostic criteria of Tuberous&nbsp;Sclerosis Complex.<br /><strong>Aims</strong>: To present the TSC1/TSC2 screening results of a mixed&nbsp;patient population as well as possible new variants in 23 cases from&nbsp;20 different families who were referred to our Genetic Diseases&nbsp;Diagnosis Center with the signs and symptoms of Tuberous Sclerosis&nbsp;Complex.<br /><strong>Study design</strong>: Retrospective, cross-sectional study.<br /><strong>Methods</strong>: Germline TSC1/TSC2 variants were screened in DNA&nbsp;samples extracted from peripheral blood samples of 23 patients&nbsp;from 20 unrelated families using targeted high-throughput&nbsp;sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification&nbsp;methods. The variants identified were classified according to ACMG&nbsp;2015 guidelines.<br /><strong>Results</strong>: In total, 5 different pathogenic/likely pathogenic changes have&nbsp;been defined. All these pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants were&nbsp;located in the TSC2 gene. Three of the pathogenic/likely pathogenic&nbsp;variants were novel. Two patients who are twin sisters were found to&nbsp;have TSC2/PKD1 contiguous deletion syndrome. One of the 3 novel&nbsp;variants was a mosaic in-frame deletion. We did not identify any pathogenic&nbsp;variants of the TSC1 gene.<br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The novelty of most of the variants found, including a&nbsp;mosaic likely pathogenic variant, and the presence of a large genomic&nbsp;rearrangement, supports the importance of a comprehensive approach&nbsp;in analyzing TSC1/TSC2 genes. Genetic diagnosis should be performed&nbsp;with caution, considering the possibility of mosaic variants with low&nbsp;allelic fractions.</p>												        					</div>
