	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) and AT1R (A1166C) gene polymorphisms in ischemic stroke patients in Trakya region and the relation between these gene polymorphisms and stroke subtypes and vascular risk factors.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: The study involved 162 patients with ischemic stroke and 146 control subjects. Ischemic stroke patients were divided into large and small vessel disease subgroups according to ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment TOAST criteria. The ACE I/D polymorphism was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the AT1R (A1166C) polymorphism was identified using PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The ACE I/D genotype distribution in patients (DD=34.0%, ID=50.0%, II=16.0%) did not differ from those in controls (DD=34.3%, ID=49.7%, II=16.1%). The AT1R A1166C genotype distribution in patients (AA=58.0%, CA=34.6%, CC=7.4%) did not significantly differ from those in controls (AA=60.1%, CA=35.7%, CC=4.2%). There was also no difference among the stroke subgroups regarding the distribution of ACE I/D and AT1R (A1166C) polymorphisms.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results show that ACE I/D and AT1R (A1166C) gene polymorphisms were not genetic risk factors for ischemic stroke in subjects in Trakya region.</p>
