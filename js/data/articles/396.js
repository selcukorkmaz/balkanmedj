Factors associated with adverse treatment outcome were &gt;65 years of age (OR: 3.39 (1.99-5.76)) ; male gender (OR:2.11 (1.49-2.99)); born outside Turkey (OR: 5.48 (2.13-14.04)); co-morbidity (OR: 1.85 (1.29-2.65)); bilateral radiologic lesions (OR: 2.07 (1.41-3.00); previous treatment history (OR: 3.99 (2.78-5.74)); 3rd month positive microscopy (OR: 4.96 (3.04-8.09)) and any H&amp;R +/- others &nbsp;multidrug resistant (MDR) resistance (OR: 22.64 (6.92-74.08)). There was no association between the adverse treatment outcome and the application site of direct observation treatment, short course (DOTS) delivery and the supervisors.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our findings indicate similar quality in DOTS application and supervision among patients with or without adverse treatment outcomes. &nbsp;However, patients with certain characteristics should be carefully monitored and aggressively treated.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
