The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship of facial anthropometric measurements with the modified Mallampati score (MMS).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Material</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: The study population consisted of 153 male and 170 female volunteers (mean ages, 48,9&plusmn;16,9 and 44,1&plusmn;15,4 years, respectively). All participants were subjected to Mallampati scoring and facial anthropometric measurements during pre-operative visit. Anthropometric measurements included inter-incisor gap, lower face height, thyrogonial length, thyromental distance and bigonial distance. The relationship of anthropometric measurements with the MMS was investigated by statistical analysis.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Bigonial distance showed a positive correlation with the MMS (r=0.857; p&lt;0.001), whereas inter-incisor gap, lower face height, and thyromental distance showed negative correlations (r=-0.809, r=-0.738, and r=-0.762 respectively p&lt;0.001 for all). ROC and AUC analysis showed that the BGD level had the highest significant AUC (p&lt;0.001). Optimal cut-off point for BGD was &gt;113 mm, and at this cut-off point, the sensitivity rate was 94.8% and the specificity rate was 95.9%. BGD was the best predictor for discriminating MMS 3-4.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: We suggest that facial measurements such as bigonial distance may be used as alternatives for Mallampati evaluation when the patient&#39;s condition is not suitable for Mallampati scoring.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
