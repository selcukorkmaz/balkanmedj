	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: The aim of our study is to measure ultimate tensile strength and elongation of pericardial patches prepared by a fixation method that can be applied just in the operating room before its implantation.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients</strong> <strong>and Methods</strong>: Pericardial patches taken from 60 patients of 50-70 years of age who underwent surgery for coronary artery bypass were studied. Pericardial patches cut in horizontal and vertical directions were treated with 0.5%, 1%, 2% concentrations of glutaraldehyde, each for 5, 10, 20-minute durations. Uniaxial tensile test was applied on pericardial samples. Thickness, tensile strength at yield, elongation at yield, tensile strength at break, elongation at break were compared between different fixation groups.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Ultimate tensile strength at yield and at break, elongation at yield and at break were found to be highest in pericardial patches treated with 2% glutaraldehyde concentration for five-minute duration.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Fixation of pericardial samples by 2% glutaraldehyde concentration for five-minute duration resulted in higher tensile strength and elongation with uniaxial stretching. Further similar studies with biaxial stretching is suggested before application in clinical practice.</p>
