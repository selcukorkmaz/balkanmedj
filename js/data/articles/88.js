However, there is a lack of studies reporting these features among polygamous and monogamous men.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Aims</strong>: The aim of this study was to investigate sociodemographic characteristics, sexual function, and psychological status of polygamously and monogamously married men.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Study Design</strong>: Cross-sectional study.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Methods</strong>: The study sample comprised two groups: 35 polygamous and 45 monogamous men in Kahramanmaraş Province, Turkey. Door-to-door surveys covered sociodemographic factors and adopted Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and International Index of Erectile Function &ndash; Erectile Function Domain (IIEF-EFD) scales.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Polygamous men showed considerably higher IIEF-EFD scores (p&lt;0.05). While the median score of IIEFEFD was 25.0 for polygamous men, it was 22.0 for monogamous men. A comparison of the two groups revealed that polygamous men had lower BDI scores. However, the difference between the groups was statistically non-significant (p&gt;0.05). Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of monogamous men for erectile dysfunction and depression were 14.4 (95% CI: 3.1-67.5) and 7.4 (95% CI: 0.9-61.9), respectively. The main reasons for multiple marriages reported by polygamous men, in descending order, were: 1) decreased satisfaction of sexual desires by a wife (37.1%); 2) falling in love with the second wife (22.8%); and 3) incompatibility with the first wife (17.1%). However, 62.9% of them responded negatively to the question: &ldquo;Would you recommend polygamous marriage to other men?&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 12px;\">\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Our results showed that polygamous men had higher erectile function and lower depression scores than monogamous men. Further studies investigating the effects of polygamy on men&rsquo;s psychosexual function are warranted. Additionally, studies that address the perspectives of offspring and women&rsquo;s expectations within polygamous marriages should be conducted.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
