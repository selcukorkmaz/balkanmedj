	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: Diabetic neuropathy (DN) is a common complication in Diabetes Mellitus. The streptozotocin-induced diabetic rodent is the most commonly used animal model of diabetes and increased sodium channel expression and activity were revealed in this model. At this study, we evaluated the effect of three different nafimidone derivatives which have possible anticonvulsant activity on disorders of thermal pain sensation in diabetic mice.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Randomized animal experiment.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and</strong> <strong>Methods</strong>: Mice were divided randomly into five groups (5 mice per group): Control, Diabetes, Dibetes+C1, Diabetes+C2, Diabetes+C3. We used hot and cold plate, and tail-immersion tests for assessment of thermal nociceptive responses.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Compared with the control group, the hot-plate response time and the number of paw liftings on cold plate as important indicators of loss of sensation increased, but no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) was found in tail-immersion response time test in diabetes group. C3 compound moved it back to control group levels in the all of three tests. C1 and C2 compounds were effective only in cold-plate test.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Nafimidone derivatives may be effective in the cases where epilepsy and diabetes occur together since it has shown efficacy against &ldquo;loss of sensation&rdquo; which evolves in diabetic neuropathy over time as well as its antiepileptic effect.</p>
