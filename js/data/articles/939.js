In histopathological examination, they are characterized with palisading in the basal layer and large keratinized &lsquo;ghost&rsquo; cell tumor appearance. Odontogenic cysts are important due to their quick growth clinically and pathologically and their high rate of recurrence. Various surgical techniques may be used in its treatment.The 56-year-old male patient admitted to our clinic with complaints of a nodule in his mandibular corpus and intermittent leakage was found to have a 5x5 cm. hard and smooth tumor. The tumor was removed by dissection from the mandibula together with its periosteal and capsule. The pathological examination led to the diagnosis of a calcifying odontogenic cyst. No recurrence was seen during the two-year follow-up of the patient. In our case, no recurrence was seen in the clinical follow-up for two years after the operation. This means that odontogenic cyst treatment is possible without grafting. We would like to focus the interest on surgical treatment of a calsifying odontogenic cyst surgery is possible without grafting and mandibular prosthesis implantation. In this way, graft resorption or implant complications may be avoided.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
