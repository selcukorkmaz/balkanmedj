In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between PrP expression and hepatic inflammation/fibrosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis (CVH).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Liver specimens of 40 patients with CVH and 10 patients with metastatic liver disease having a normal liver architecture as a control group were evaluated. ThePrP staining index was calculated by counting PrP positive cells per microscopic field after immunostaining. Hepatic inflammatory activity and fibrosis scores were evaluated and compared with the number of PrP positive HSC.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: Varying degrees of PrP expression were detected in histologic samples of the liver in patients with CVH, whereas no staining was observed in control specimens. It was also detected that the grade of inflammatory activity and stage of liver fibrosis were significantly correlated with PrP staining index (p=0.0001 for inflammation and p=0.005 for fibrosis).</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Conclusions</strong>: PrP is a good marker of activated HSC and correlates well with the inflammatory activity and stage of fibrosis in CVH.</span></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
