	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: There are limited data regarding anger and its management with respect to physicians and many other professionals. Our objective was to evaluate anger expression and control in physicians.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: The physicians of the D&uuml;zce School of Medicine were the participants in the study. Physicians were assigned to either an internal medicine or a surgery study group. Each group contained physicians from several specialties. The Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories were administered to all participants. The physicians (n=158) were evaluated and compared with controls (n=105) in terms of anger control and sociodemographic variables.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Anger-control scores were higher in physicians (p&lt;0.01) and in those who willingly chose the medical profession (p&lt;0.05). Age, number of years as a physician, and the specialty were negatively correlated with anger management in physicians working in the surgical disciplines (p&lt;0.01). Only Beck anxiety and depression scores were positively correlated with anger-trait scores and anger-in scores for physicians working in the internal medicine disciplines (p&lt;0.01).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Physicians were relatively successful in coping with anger. A willingness to choose the medical profession was a factor influencing anger control. Age was the major factor affecting anger management in physicians.</p>
