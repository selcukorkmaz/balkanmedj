												        						<p><strong>Aims:</strong> Patients with the Pendred syndrome suffer very often from a hearing loss. They may be good candidates for a cochlear implantation, but unfortunately, due to the fluctuating character of the hearing loss, they may escape such indication. In the study, we compared speech production and speech acquisition in 2 groups of implanted patients: those with the Pendred syndrome, and standard non-syndromic patients.<br /><strong>Methods:</strong> Ten patients with Pendred syndrome were analyzed for speech perception and production. The control group consisted of 41 non-syndromic implanted patients. All implantees were scored according to speech perception, speech production, and the sum of both. The data were statistically analyzed.<br /><strong>Results:</strong> No statistical difference was found in language acquisition and production in implantees with Pendred syndrome when compared to non-syndromic patients with cochlear implants. Nor there was any difference in speech production and acquisition between the 2 compared groups regarding surgical age, time elapsed after surgery, or age during the testing.<br /><strong>Conclusion:</strong> In this study evaluating language and speech production and acquisition, patients with Pendred syndrome who underwent cochlear implants show comparable results to their implanted peers with deafness of a different etiology.</p>												        					</div>
