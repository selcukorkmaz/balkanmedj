In each subject, 16 measurements of intracranial structures were taken on MR images. Area of corpus callosum, also left and right cerebral hemispheres, length of CC, width of genu (r1), truncus (r2), isthmus (r3) and splenium of CC (r4) and width of corresponding cerebral hemisphere were measured.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Results</strong>: There was a statistically significant difference in R3 (width of the corresponding cerebral hemisphere to r3) distance between those using their right feet and those using their left feet. Angle of genu in right-handed people was greater in males than in females. Angle of genu in cases using the left foot was greater in females than in males for standing on one leg.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Morphometric assessment of CC with MR imaging related to handedness and footedness may be useful in demonstrating the relationship between callosal morphology, gender differences and extremity preference in neuroscience.</span></p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
