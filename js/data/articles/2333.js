In medicine, the use of new technologies in patient diagnosis and treatment processes has opened new horizons for physicians and patients. As considering for the medical training, 3-dimensional modeling opportunities, virtual reality, augmented reality, and various simulators offered by the new technologies of the digital era have become a new hope. The 3-dimensional scanning and modeling, 3-dimensional medical printing, virtual reality technologies applications and simulators in urology are very recent and valuable. Besides, the exoscope-assisted 3-dimensional open surgery provides high-resolution 3-dimensional images to surgeons with high comfort as compared with old-fashioned operating&nbsp;microscopes. New modalities that tried to be integrated in robotic surgery are 3-dimensional reconstruction, usage of indocyanine green, augmented reality, contrast ultrasound, haptic feedback, and availability of single port. Some new companies announced their new robotic systems in the market. The use of these new technological applications during medical training, especially at the beginning of the education curve for various surgical interventions, may be beneficial in terms of reducing possible complications that may be encountered due to inexperience at the beginning of the education process and increasing patient safety. Urology will also stay at the futuristic approach in medicine, while 3-dimensional technologies used more widely in this field.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
