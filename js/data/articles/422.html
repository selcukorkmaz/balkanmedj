	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objective</strong>: The purpose of this dosimetric study is the targeted dose homogeneity and critical organ dose comparison of 7-field Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and 3-D 4-field conformal radiotherapy.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Study</strong> <strong>Design</strong>: Cross sectional study.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Material and Methods</strong>: Twenty patients with low and moderate risk prostate cancer treated at G&uuml;lhane Military Medical School Radiation Oncology Department between January 2009 and December 2009 are included in this study. Two seperate dosimetric plans both for 7-field IMRT and 3D-CRT have been generated for each patient to comparatively evaluate the dosimetric status of both techniques and all the patients received 7-field IMRT.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Dose-comparative evaluation of two techniques revealed the superiority of IMRT technique with statistically significantly lower femoral head doses along with reduced critical organ dose-volume parameters of bladder V60 (the volume receiving 60 Gy) and rectal V40 (the volume receiving 40 Gy) and V60.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: It can be concluded that IMRT is an effective definitive management tool for prostate cancer with improved critical organ sparing and excellent dose homogenization in target organs of prostate and seminal vesicles.</p>
