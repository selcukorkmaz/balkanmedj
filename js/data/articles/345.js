The cells were seeds in 96-wellplates (100&mu;L/hole) or in 6cm diameter dishes (2 mL/dish) with the density of 1&times;106/mL and randomly divided into 4 groups (n=6 each): control group (Group N), hypoxia-regoxygen group (Group H/R), Diazoxide preconditioning+H/R group (Group DZ) and Diazoxide preconditioning +mitochondrial KATP blocker 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD) + H/R group (Group DZ+5-HD). The cells were exposed to 2h hypoxia followed by 2h reoxygenation. Diazoxide 100&mu;mol/L and diazoxide 100&mu;mol/L+ 5-HD100&mu;mol/L were added to the culture medium 2h before hypoxia in DZ and DZ+5-HD groups respectively. Each group was observed the proliferation in MTT, apoptotic rate in Annexin V-FITC/PI double standard, cell structure of Hoechst staining, and the levels of PI3K, Akt and p53 mRNA by RT-qPCR.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: Compared with Group N, apoptotic rate of Group H/R increased (p&lt;0.01) and the vitality decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05), and the expression of PI3K, Akt and p53 mRNA elevated in Group H/R (p&lt;0.05). Compared with Group H/R, apoptotic rate and p53 mRNA level of Group DZ depressed significantly (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.05), while the vitality, PI3K and Akt mRNA levels increased (p&lt;0.05). Compared with Group DZ, apoptotic rate and p53 mRNA level of Group DZ+5-HD increased significantly (p&lt;0.01, p&lt;0.05), but the vitality, PI3K and Akt mRNA levels decreased (p&lt;0.05).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Under the condition of H/R, mito-KATP opened by DZ may depend on PI3K/Akt pathway to regulate expression level of the downstream p53 mRNA to inhibit apoptosis and improve viability of MMECs at the same time.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
