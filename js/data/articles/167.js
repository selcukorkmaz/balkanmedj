Patients were allocated into two groups based on the presence or absence of ST elevation in leads V3R/V4R. Demographic, biochemical and echocardiographic data, as well as the angiographic information, were recorded. In-hospital and 3 month mortality, and major adverse cardiac events (MACE), death, heart failure and ventricular dysrhythmia were also compared.</p>\r\n<p ckeditor=\"\" cms.galenos.com.tr=\"\" http:=\"\" images=\"\" javascript=\"\" plugins=\"\" showblocks=\"\" style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: left top; border: 1px dotted gray; padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 8px; background-image: url(\">\r\n\t<strong>Results</strong>: ST elevation in lead V3R or V4R was present in 72 out of 111 patients (64.9%). Involvement of the proximal part of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery was not different in the two groups (44.4% of patients with elevation vs. 53.8% of patients without elevation, p=0.22). Post-myocardial infarction complications, mortality and major adverse cardiac events were similar in the two groups. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly lower in patients with ST elevation in V3R/V4R (35 %&plusmn;8 vs. 38 %&plusmn;8, p=0.02). Twenty three out of 111 patients (20.7%) developed heart failure, which was similar in the two groups [16 (22.2%) of patients with ST elevation vs. 7 (17.9%) of patients without ST elevation, p=0.39].</p>\r\n<p ckeditor=\"\" cms.galenos.com.tr=\"\" http:=\"\" images=\"\" javascript=\"\" plugins=\"\" showblocks=\"\" style=\"background-repeat: no-repeat; background-position: left top; border: 1px dotted gray; padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 8px; background-image: url(\">\r\n\t<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Although ST elevation in V3R/V4R can be present in patients with left anterior descending artery occlusion, it does not seem to predict the prognosis. Lower left ventricular ejection fraction in this group may play a role in the long-term prognosis; however, this issue needs further investigation.</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<!--\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t<div\tstyle=\"width:20%; float:left; min-height:150px; padding:10px; padding-top:40px;\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"selected_menu\" href=\"#summary_en\">Summary</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t-->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        \t</div>";
