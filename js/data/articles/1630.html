	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: This study was designed to compare serum total and lipid-bound sialic acid levels obtained from patients with and without coronary obstruction.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods</strong>: Serum total and lipid-bound sialic acid levels were determined in 42 patients (29 men, 13 women; mean age 58 years; range 32 to 75 years) with angiographically documented coronary obstruction and in 35 patients (22 men, 13 women; mean age 54 years; range 39 to 75 years) with no obstruction. Serum total and lipid-bound sialic acid levels were determined by the methods of Warren and Katopodis, respectively. The results were compared with the use of one-way ANOVA test.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: Serum total and lipid-bound sialic acid levels were significantly higher in patients with coronary obstruction (81.01&plusmn;10.10 mg/dl and 33.59&plusmn;7.00 mg/dl, respectively) when compared with those of patients with no obstruction (65.18&plusmn;10.23 mg/dl and 25.28&plusmn;7.40 mg/dl, respectively) (p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: The measurement of serum total and lipid-bound sialic acid levels may be useful in distinguishing between patients with and without coronary obstruction.</p>
