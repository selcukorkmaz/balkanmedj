	Abstract</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Objectives</strong>: Hydatidosis is frequently seen in Turkey due to social and geographical conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of treatment in patients with hydatidosis.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Patients and Methods: </strong>The study included 120 patients (35 males, 85 females; mean age 40.7 years; range 7 to 75 years) who underwent treatment for hydatidosis. Data on diagnostic evaluation, medical and surgical treatments, and follow-up results were reviewed.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Results</strong>: The most frequent complaints were abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Fifty-four patients were found normal on physical examination. The most frequent findings were hepatomegaly and abdominal mass. The cysts developed in other abdominal organs other than the liver in 21 patients. Treatment was medical in 16 patients, and six patients underwent PAIR (Percutaneous aspiration, injection, and reaspiration). The preferred surgical procedure was partial cystectomy. Medical treatment was added to surgery in 55 patients. The most frequent surgical complication was wound infection (12.8%). Recurrences were encountered in 16.3%.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Conservative surgery which is the preferred option for main line of treatment is adequate and reliable for hydatidosis. Addition of medical agents may increase treatment success rate.</p>
