	Abstract</h3>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Background</strong>: We investigated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of once-monthly administration of C.E.R.A. in erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) naive predialysis patients with CKD for anemia treatment</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Study Design</strong>: Single arm, open label study.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Methods</strong>: A total of 75 patients (mean (SD) age was 52.8 (16.4) years, 76.0% were female) were included in this study conducted between 12 August 2008 and 30 October 2009 in 9 centers across Turkey. The mean change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between baseline (week 0) and the efficacy evaluation period (EEP) was the primary efficacy parameter evaluated in three consecutive periods including a dose titration period (DTP; with initial 1.2 &mu;g/kg dose of C.E.R.A., subcutaneously, 28 weeks), EEP (8 weeks) and a long-term safety period (16 weeks).</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Results</strong>: Our analysis revealed an improvement in Hb levels from baseline value of 9.4 (0.4) g/dL to time adjusted average level of 11.4 (0.7) g/dL in EEP in the per protocol (PP) population and from 9.3 (0.5) g/dL to 11.1 (1.0) g/dL in intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Mean (SD) change in Hb levels from baseline to EEP was 2.0 (0.7) g/dl in the PP population (primary endpoint) and 1.7 (1.1) g/dL in the ITT population. The percentage of patients whose Hb concentrations remained within the target range of 10.0-12.0 g/dL throughout the EEP was 43.9% (95% CI: 28.5-60.3%) in the PP population and 38.7% (95% CI: 27.6% to 50.6%) in the ITP population. A total of 206 adverse events (AE) were reported in 77.0% of patients with hypertension (20%) as the most frequent AE.</p>
<p style="font-size: 12px;">
	<strong>Conclusion</strong>: Once-monthly subcutaneous C.E.R.A. administration is effective and safe in the treatment of anemia in pre-dialysis patients with CKD, who are not currently treated with ESAs.&nbsp;</p>
