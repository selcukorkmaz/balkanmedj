        abstract: "Background: Atrial fibrillation recurrence after catheter ablation remains a significant clinical challenge. Left atrial strain parameters assessed by speckle-tracking echocardiography may offer incremental prognostic value. Aims: To evaluate whether pre-procedural left atrial reservoir strain independently predicts atrial fibrillation recurrence within 12 months of catheter ablation. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: We enrolled 214 consecutive patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation who underwent pulmonary vein isolation at a single tertiary center between January 2022 and June 2023. Left atrial reservoir strain was measured using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography prior to ablation. The primary endpoint was documented atrial fibrillation recurrence after a 90-day blanking period. Results: During a median follow-up of 14.2 months, atrial fibrillation recurred in 68 patients (31.8%). Patients with recurrence had significantly lower left atrial reservoir strain (15.4% vs. 22.8%, p<0.001). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, left atrial reservoir strain below 18% was independently associated with recurrence (hazard ratio 2.41; 95% confidence interval 1.52-3.83; p<0.001) after adjustment for left atrial volume index, CHA2DS2-VASc score, and atrial fibrillation type. Conclusion: Pre-procedural left atrial reservoir strain is an independent predictor of atrial fibrillation recurrence after catheter ablation and may help refine patient selection for the procedure.",

        abstract: "Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed the management of non-small cell lung cancer, yet reliable biomarkers for treatment response remain limited. Aims: To investigate the prognostic significance of baseline and on-treatment serum interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: We analyzed serum samples from 178 patients with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer treated with first-line pembrolizumab between March 2021 and December 2023 at three centers across the Balkans. Cytokine levels were measured at baseline and at weeks 6 and 12 of treatment. Progression-free survival and overall survival were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Elevated baseline interleukin-6 (above 12.5 pg/mL) was associated with shorter progression-free survival (median 4.8 vs. 9.3 months; p=0.002) and overall survival (median 11.2 vs. 19.7 months; p<0.001). A greater than 40% reduction in interleukin-6 at week 6 correlated with improved objective response rate (52.3% vs. 21.1%; p<0.001). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels did not show independent prognostic value. Conclusion: Serum interleukin-6 may serve as a dynamic biomarker for monitoring immunotherapy response in non-small cell lung cancer.",

        abstract: "Inflammatory bowel disease, encompassing Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, affects an increasing number of individuals in the Balkan region and worldwide. Accumulating evidence implicates gut microbiota dysbiosis as a central driver of disease initiation, perpetuation, and relapse. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between January 2015 and June 2024 that characterized gut microbiota composition in inflammatory bowel disease patients compared with healthy controls. Of 2,847 records screened, 62 studies met inclusion criteria comprising 4,318 patients and 3,126 healthy controls. Pooled analyses demonstrated significant reductions in alpha diversity (standardized mean difference -0.74; 95% confidence interval -0.92 to -0.56; p<0.001) and depletion of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (standardized mean difference -1.12; 95% confidence interval -1.38 to -0.86) in inflammatory bowel disease patients. We further discuss emerging therapeutic strategies including fecal microbiota transplantation, next-generation probiotics, and dietary interventions that target microbial restoration. Current evidence supports microbiota-directed therapies as adjuncts to standard treatment, though long-term efficacy data remain sparse. Future large-scale, well-designed randomized controlled trials are warranted to establish optimal protocols for microbiome-based interventions.",

        abstract: "Background: Healthcare workers face unique occupational stressors including irregular shift patterns and sedentary behavior that may predispose them to metabolic derangements. Aims: To determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and identify associated risk factors among healthcare workers across four Balkan countries. Study Design: Multicenter cross-sectional study. Methods: A total of 1,236 healthcare workers from eight hospitals in Türkiye, Serbia, Greece, and Albania were enrolled between September 2023 and March 2024. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the harmonized International Diabetes Federation criteria. Anthropometric measurements, fasting laboratory values, dietary habits, physical activity levels, and shift work patterns were recorded. Results: The overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 28.4% (95% confidence interval 25.9-31.0), with significant variation across countries (range 23.1-34.7%). Night shift work exceeding eight nights per month was independently associated with metabolic syndrome (odds ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.31-2.42; p<0.001). Physical inactivity, defined as fewer than 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, was present in 62.3% of participants. Abdominal obesity was the most prevalent individual component (41.2%). Conclusion: Metabolic syndrome is highly prevalent among Balkan healthcare workers, with night shift work emerging as a significant modifiable risk factor. Targeted workplace wellness programs are urgently needed.",

        abstract: "Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis is an autoimmune condition that frequently mimics primary psychiatric disorders, leading to diagnostic delays. We report the case of a 16-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with acute-onset auditory hallucinations, disorganized behavior, and agitation over two days. Initial psychiatric evaluation suggested first-episode psychosis, and antipsychotic therapy was initiated. Over the following 72 hours the patient developed new-onset seizures, orofacial dyskinesias, and autonomic instability. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis and the presence of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed subtle signal abnormalities in the medial temporal lobes bilaterally. Comprehensive tumor screening including testicular ultrasonography and whole-body computed tomography did not reveal an underlying neoplasm. The patient received first-line immunotherapy with intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange, followed by second-line therapy with rituximab. Over six months, he achieved substantial neurological recovery with mild residual cognitive deficits. This case underscores the importance of considering autoimmune encephalitis in the differential diagnosis of acute psychiatric presentations, particularly when atypical features such as seizures or movement disorders emerge.",

Aims: To assess the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction and its impact on glycemic control in a large population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Study Design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Methods: We analyzed data from 3,842 adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus registered in three national diabetes registries in Türkiye, Bulgaria, and Serbia between January 2020 and December 2023. Thyroid function was assessed using serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels. Glycemic control was evaluated by hemoglobin A1c. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify associations between thyroid status and glycemic parameters. Results: Thyroid dysfunction was identified in 19.7% of the cohort: subclinical hypothyroidism in 12.4%, overt hypothyroidism in 3.8%, subclinical hyperthyroidism in 2.1%, and overt hyperthyroidism in 1.4%. Subclinical hypothyroidism was independently associated with hemoglobin A1c above 8% (odds ratio 1.56; 95% confidence interval 1.22-1.99; p<0.001) and dyslipidemia (odds ratio 1.43; 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.84; p=0.006). Female sex and body mass index above 30 were additional risk factors for concurrent thyroid dysfunction. Conclusion: Thyroid dysfunction, particularly subclinical hypothyroidism, is common among patients with type 2 diabetes and is associated with poorer glycemic control, supporting routine thyroid screening in this population.",

        abstract: "Precision medicine represents a paradigm shift in clinical care, leveraging genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data to tailor therapeutic strategies to individual patients. While high-income countries have invested substantially in precision medicine infrastructure, the Balkan region faces unique challenges in implementing these approaches, including limited genomic sequencing capacity, fragmented healthcare systems, and inadequate bioinformatics workforce development. However, the Balkans also possess distinct advantages: ethnically diverse populations that can enrich pharmacogenomic databases, strong clinical training traditions, and a growing network of academic collaborations. This editorial discusses the current landscape of precision medicine across Southeastern Europe, highlights successful regional initiatives such as the Balkan Genomics Consortium, and proposes a roadmap for expanding access to genomic testing, building shared biobanks, and harmonizing regulatory frameworks. We argue that collaborative multicenter studies leveraging the region's demographic diversity can generate insights of global relevance while addressing local health priorities. The Balkan Medical Journal is committed to publishing high-quality translational research that bridges the gap between molecular discoveries and clinical application in our region.",

        abstract: "Background: Heart failure readmissions represent a major burden on healthcare systems across the Balkans. Telemonitoring interventions have shown promise in reducing hospitalizations, but evidence from the region is scarce. Aims: To evaluate the effect of a structured nurse-led telemonitoring program on 90-day all-cause readmission rates in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Study Design: Multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Methods: We randomized 326 patients with heart failure (ejection fraction below 40%) discharged from three university hospitals in Türkiye, Serbia, and Bulgaria between January 2023 and September 2024 to either a telemonitoring group (n=163) or standard care (n=163). The intervention included daily remote transmission of body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and symptom questionnaires, with nurse-led triage and physician escalation protocols. Results: The 90-day all-cause readmission rate was 18.4% in the telemonitoring group versus 31.3% in the standard care group (relative risk 0.59; 95% confidence interval 0.41-0.84; p=0.003). The telemonitoring group also had fewer emergency department visits (0.42 vs. 0.78 per patient; p=0.01) and shorter mean length of stay during readmissions (5.1 vs. 7.8 days; p=0.02). Patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the intervention group. Conclusion: Nurse-led telemonitoring significantly reduces heart failure readmissions and may be a cost-effective strategy for the Balkan region.",

        abstract: "Background: The overlap syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity. Pulmonary hypertension is a known complication of both conditions, yet its relationship with obstructive sleep apnea severity in the overlap population is poorly characterized. Aims: To evaluate the association between obstructive sleep apnea severity as measured by the apnea-hypopnea index and pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Study Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Methods: We enrolled 189 patients with established chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease stages II-IV) who underwent diagnostic polysomnography for suspected obstructive sleep apnea. Pulmonary arterial systolic pressure was estimated by transthoracic echocardiography. Patients were stratified by obstructive sleep apnea severity. Results: Obstructive sleep apnea was confirmed in 142 patients (75.1%): mild in 38, moderate in 51, and severe in 53. Mean pulmonary arterial systolic pressure increased across severity groups (32.4, 37.8, and 44.6 mmHg respectively; p for trend <0.001). In multivariate regression, apnea-hypopnea index was independently associated with pulmonary arterial systolic pressure after adjusting for forced expiratory volume, body mass index, and smoking pack-years. Conclusion: Obstructive sleep apnea severity is independently associated with elevated pulmonary arterial pressure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, highlighting the importance of systematic sleep evaluation in this population.",

        abstract: "Immune thrombocytopenia is a well-recognized hematologic manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus that can be refractory to standard immunosuppressive therapies. We describe a 34-year-old woman with an eight-year history of systemic lupus erythematosus who developed severe immune thrombocytopenia with a platelet count nadir of 8,000 per microliter. Her thrombocytopenia was refractory to high-dose corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab over a 14-month period. She experienced recurrent mucocutaneous bleeding and required multiple platelet transfusions. Eltrombopag, a thrombopoietin receptor agonist, was initiated at 50 mg daily and titrated to 75 mg daily. Within four weeks, her platelet count rose to 87,000 per microliter and stabilized above 100,000 per microliter by week eight. No thromboembolic complications occurred during 18 months of follow-up. Eltrombopag was well tolerated and allowed successful tapering of corticosteroids. We also review the current literature on thrombopoietin receptor agonists in lupus-associated immune thrombocytopenia, summarizing data from 23 published cases. This case supports eltrombopag as a viable option for refractory lupus-associated immune thrombocytopenia when conventional therapies fail.",

Aims: To investigate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its relationship with disease activity in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Study Design: Multicenter cross-sectional study. Methods: We enrolled 184 patients aged 2-16 years with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and 92 age- and sex-matched healthy controls from three pediatric rheumatology centers in Türkiye and North Macedonia. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were measured in all participants. Disease activity was assessed using the Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS-27). Vitamin D deficiency was defined as a serum level below 20 ng/mL. Results: Vitamin D deficiency was significantly more prevalent in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients than controls (58.7% vs. 33.7%; p<0.001). Patients with active disease (JADAS-27 above 10) had lower mean vitamin D levels compared with those in remission (14.2 vs. 23.8 ng/mL; p<0.001). In multivariable analysis, vitamin D deficiency was independently associated with higher JADAS-27 scores after adjusting for age, sex, disease subtype, and treatment. A negative correlation between vitamin D levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate was observed. Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent among children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and is associated with increased disease activity.

        abstract: "Treatment-resistant depression affects approximately one-third of patients with major depressive disorder and is associated with significant morbidity, functional impairment, and increased healthcare utilization. Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and theta burst stimulation, have emerged as promising therapeutic modalities for patients who do not respond to pharmacotherapy. This narrative review examines the current evidence base for these techniques, focusing on randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses published between 2018 and 2024. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex remains the most extensively studied approach, with response rates of 40-55% and remission rates of 25-35% in treatment-resistant populations. Accelerated protocols, particularly Stanford neuromodulation therapy, have demonstrated rapid onset of antidepressant effects with remission rates approaching 80% in initial studies, though replication in larger trials is ongoing. Transcranial direct current stimulation offers advantages of portability and low cost but has shown more modest effect sizes. We discuss optimal stimulation parameters, patient selection strategies, biomarker-guided targeting using neuroimaging, and the integration of brain stimulation with psychotherapy. Limitations of the current literature, including heterogeneous study designs and limited long-term follow-up data, are also addressed. Future directions emphasize personalized stimulation protocols guided by individual brain connectivity profiles.",

Early prediction may facilitate timely preventive interventions. Aims: To develop and externally validate a machine learning model for predicting acute kidney injury within 48 hours of intensive care unit admission. Study Design: Retrospective multicenter cohort study. Methods: We developed gradient boosting, random forest, and logistic regression models using data from 4,216 intensive care unit admissions at Hacettepe University Hospital (development cohort, 2019-2023). The models incorporated 42 clinical and laboratory variables available within the first six hours of admission. External validation was performed using 1,834 admissions from two hospitals in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Bulgaria. Acute kidney injury was defined using Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Results: In the development cohort, the gradient boosting model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.891 (95% confidence interval 0.874-0.908), outperforming random forest (0.863) and logistic regression (0.812). In external validation, the gradient boosting model maintained robust performance with an area under the curve of 0.854 (95% confidence interval 0.831-0.877). The top predictive features were baseline serum creatinine, urine output in the first six hours, lactate level, and vasopressor use. Conclusion: A machine learning approach using readily available clinical data can accurately predict acute kidney injury in critically ill patients across diverse Balkan healthcare settings.",

The simultaneous occurrence of myasthenia gravis, myocarditis, and myositis, termed the triple M syndrome, is rare but carries a mortality rate exceeding 50%. We present a 62-year-old male with metastatic melanoma who developed progressive ptosis, diplopia, proximal limb weakness, and dyspnea 18 days after the second cycle of nivolumab. Initial evaluation revealed elevated creatine kinase (4,820 U/L) and troponin I (8.4 ng/mL). Electrocardiography showed new-onset atrioventricular block. Electromyography demonstrated a decremental response on repetitive nerve stimulation, and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were positive. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed active myocarditis with diffuse late gadolinium enhancement. The patient required mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. Treatment included high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, and mycophenolate mofetil. Nivolumab was permanently discontinued. After a prolonged 34-day intensive care unit stay, the patient gradually recovered and was discharged with mild residual weakness. At six-month follow-up, cardiac function normalized and myasthenic symptoms resolved. This case illustrates the critical importance of early recognition of this devastating triad in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

Seroprevalence data from southeastern Türkiye remain limited. Aims: To determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus antibodies among pregnant women in Diyarbakir, southeastern Türkiye. Methods: Serum samples from 468 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics at Dicle University Hospital between January and August 2024 were tested for anti-hepatitis E virus immunoglobulin G and immunoglobulin M using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Demographic and clinical data were collected via structured questionnaires. Results: Anti-hepatitis E virus immunoglobulin G was detected in 34 women (7.3%; 95% confidence interval 5.2-10.0). Anti-hepatitis E virus immunoglobulin M, indicating recent or active infection, was positive in 3 women (0.6%). Seroprevalence was significantly higher among women living in rural areas (11.2% vs. 5.4%; p=0.03) and those using untreated water sources (14.8% vs. 5.9%; p=0.008). No significant associations were found with age, parity, or trimester. All three immunoglobulin M-positive women had mildly elevated transaminases but no clinical hepatitis. Conclusion: Hepatitis E virus seroprevalence among pregnant women in southeastern Türkiye is notable and associated with rural residence and untreated water use, underscoring the need for improved water sanitation and potential screening strategies in this vulnerable population.",

While the authors should be commended for their well-designed prospective study, we wish to raise several points for further discussion. First, the proposed procalcitonin cutoff of 0.5 ng/mL, while demonstrating high sensitivity (94.2%), may lack sufficient specificity in populations with high rates of concurrent bacterial infections, a common scenario in Balkan pediatric emergency departments during winter months. In our experience at two tertiary pediatric centers in Türkiye, co-existing urinary tract infections and pneumonia elevated procalcitonin levels in 18% of children ultimately diagnosed with viral meningitis. Second, the study excluded children who received antibiotics prior to lumbar puncture, yet in real-world practice up to 40% of children receive empirical antibiotics before cerebrospinal fluid sampling. We suggest that the diagnostic algorithm be validated in a pragmatic cohort that includes pretreated patients. Finally, combining procalcitonin with cerebrospinal fluid lactate may further improve diagnostic accuracy, as our preliminary data suggest an area under the curve of 0.96 for the combined panel.",

Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a 2.8 x 1.9 cm mobile, hyperechoic mass attached to the mitral valve annulus, initially suspected to be a left atrial myxoma. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a non-enhancing, heavily calcified lesion with low signal intensity on both T1- and T2-weighted sequences, atypical for myxoma. The patient underwent successful surgical excision. Gross examination revealed a calcified, amorphous, non-encapsulated mass. Histopathological analysis showed nodular calcium deposits within a fibrinous matrix with scattered chronic inflammatory cells and no evidence of neoplastic tissue, confirming the diagnosis of calcified amorphous tumor. This rare entity accounts for fewer than 1% of primary cardiac tumors and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of intracardiac masses, particularly when imaging reveals heavy calcification. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice given the embolic risk, and recurrence is uncommon.",
