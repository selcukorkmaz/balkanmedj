    abstract: "Carotid atherosclerosis is a key cause of ischemic stroke strongly associated with increased risks of cardiovascular disease and vascular death. This study performs single-cell sequencing to dissect the cellular subpopulations in carotid atherosclerosis. Single-cell sequencing data were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Multiple cellular subpopulations associated with carotid atherosclerosis were identified, engaging in intercellular communication via distinct signaling pathways. Cannabidiol exhibits strong binding affinities for the macrophage, endothelial, and vascular smooth muscle cell markers. Spatial transcriptomics revealed that ACTC1, AKR1C2, and FABP4 exhibit region-specific expression patterns within plaques, offering fresh insights into carotid atherosclerosis therapy.",

This multicenter Turkish study examined 16 individuals from 15 families, identifying 15 distinct KMT2A variants—nine of which were novel. The research revealed prominent neurodevelopmental involvement including developmental delays, intellectual disability, and behavioral comorbidities. Growth hormone deficiency was documented in approximately half of tested patients. Additional findings encompassed ophthalmologic, cardiac, dental, skeletal, genitourinary, and immunological abnormalities. KMT2A functions as an umbrella gene within the chromatinopathy spectrum.",

    abstract: "Depression and hearing loss commonly occur in the aging population and may arise from shared mechanisms. Adults aged 55 and older from three nationally representative study cohorts were included: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the Health and Retirement Study, and the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Cross-sectional analyses revealed that depression was significantly associated with higher pure-tone average thresholds. In pooled longitudinal analyses of 6,956 participants, individuals with baseline depression exhibited a higher incidence of hearing loss. Increasing (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.09-2.21) and fluctuating (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.12-1.39) depressive symptom trajectories were independent predictors of hearing loss, whereas decreasing trajectories indicated no significant association.",
