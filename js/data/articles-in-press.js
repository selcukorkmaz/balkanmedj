    "abstract": "Abstract Background: The fetal liver is perfused by the umbilical vein (UV) and the main portal vein (MPV), both of which are crucial for nutrient delivery. The configuration of the umbilicoportal anastomosis may influence MPV blood flow and potentially affect fetal liver perfusion in fetuses with fetal growth restriction (FGR). Aims: To evaluate absolute and normalized UV and MPV blood flows in fetuses with normal growth and FGR, and to investigate the effect of umbilicoportal anastomosis type on MPV flow. Study Design: This prospective case\u2013control study included 108 appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) fetuses and 43 FGR fetuses between 18 and 37 weeks of gestation, evaluated over nine months. Methods: Ultrasound was used to measure UV and MPV diameters, while Doppler ultrasound assessed time-averaged maximum velocities. Flow volumes were calculated as time-averaged maximum velocity volume and normalized to estimated fetal weight (TAMXVVN) and abdominal circumference. Anastomoses were categorized as T-, X-, or H-shaped. Z-scores were derived from AGA nomograms. Results: Compared with AGA fetuses, FGR fetuses exhibited significantly smaller UV diameters, lower absolute UV flow, UV-TAMXVVN, and UV-TAMXVV/AC (p < 0.05), but higher MPV-TAMXVVN (p < 0.05), suggesting compensatory redistribution. Both UV and MPV flows showed strong correlations with gestational age (r > 0.7, p < 0.001). UV-TAMXVVN Z-scores decreased with gestation, whereas MPV-TAMXVVN Z-scores increased until 32 weeks before plateauing. Blood flow parameters did not differ significantly across anastomosis types in either group. Conclusion: FGR fetuses demonstrate reduced UV perfusion with compensatory increases in MPV flow. The type of umbilicoportal anastomosis does not significantly affect MPV blood flow.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Cesarean section is frequently performed for breech presentation; however, external cephalic version (ECV) is recommended as an alternative strategy to increase the likelihood of vaginal birth. Tocolytics agents are commonly administrated to improve ECV success, yet the comparative effectiveness of different regimes remains inadequately characterized. Aims: To systematically evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of various tocolytic agents in facilitating successful ECV through a Bayesian network meta-analysis. Study Design: Bayesian network meta-analysis. Methods: Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed using the \u201cgemtc\u201d package in R 4.1.1. Treatment effects were quantified by calculating odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% credible intervals (CrIs). Surface under the cumulative ranking curve values were used to rank tocolytic agents according to ECV success rates, maternal outcomes, and adverse events. Results: A total of sixteen RCTs encompassing 2,817 participants and six distinct tocolytic agents met the inclusion criteria. Compared with placebo, terbutaline (OR: 2.7, 95% CrI: 1.1\u20136.4) and ritodrine (OR: 2.2, 95% CrI: 1.4\u20133.9) were associated with significantly higher ECV success rates. Additionally, terbutaline was linked to an increased likelihood of vaginal delivery (OR: 2.0, 95% CrI: 1.0\u20132.9). Maternal adverse effects, including tachycardia, palpitations, hypotension, nausea, dizziness, and flushing, were more frequently reported with terbutaline, nifedipine, and nitroglycerin than with placebo. No statistically significant differences in fetal heart rate abnormalities were detected among the elevated interventions. Conclusion: Terbutaline and ritodrine appear to offer superior efficacy in improving ECV success compared with alternative tocolytic agents, albeit with a higher incidence of maternal side effects. Consequently, clinical decision-making regarding tocolytic use should be informed by a comprehensive assessment of the associated benefits and potential risks.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Childhood interstitial lung diseases (chILD) and immunodeficiencies are rare, heterogeneous, and clinically challenging disorders. Aims: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiological characteristics of immunodeficiency-related chILD using data from the T\u00fcrkiye chILD Registry (chILD-TR).Study Design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data collected from the chILD-TR in 2023. Methods: Patients registered with the B3 code, according to the chILD-European classification, from 18 participating centers were included. Patients were classified into primary immunodeficiency (PID) and secondary immunodeficiency (SID) groups. Demographic, clinical, and radiological variables were compared between the two groups. Results: Among 667 patients registered in the chILD-TR, 114 (17%) had immunodeficiency-related chILD, including 53 (47%) females. The median current age was 156 months (range: 23\u2013357), the age at symptom onset was 60 months (range: 0\u2013215), and the age at chILD diagnosis was 85 months (range: 2\u2013217). PID was identified in 77 patients (67.6%) and SID in 37 patients (32.4%). The PID group had significantly lower median current age, age at first symptom, and age at chILD diagnosis compared with the SID group (p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in growth z-scores between the groups (p > 0.05). A history of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and a diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) were more frequent in the SID group (p < 0.05). The most common computed tomography findings were ground-glass opacities in PID and mosaic perfusion in SID. During follow-up, 14 patients (12.3%) died. Conclusion: Immunodeficiency-associated chILD encompasses a heterogeneous spectrum of disorders and is associated with increased mortality. Distinct clinical and radiological patterns were observed between PID and SID. These findings underscore the importance of early detection, individualized diagnostic strategies, and ongoing follow-up to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. Recognition of post-infectious BO and following HSCT is critical for timely intervention.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Accurate identification of medulloblastoma molecular subgroups is essential, particularly in settings lacking advanced genomic tools. Conventional markers, such as \u03b2-catenin, present significant challenges in reliably detecting the WNT-activated subgroup (WNT-AG). Aims: To evaluate the utility of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1), Cyclin D1, and receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (ROR2) as immunohistochemical (IHC) markers for molecular subgroup classification and to assess their prognostic significance. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: IHC analysis was performed using LEF1, Cyclin D1, and ROR2. Two distinct LEF1 staining patterns were identified: nuclear (nLEF1) and punctate (pLEF1). A subset of 29 cases, selected based on predefined criteria, underwent EPIC array Methylation analysis. Findings were correlated with recurrence and survival outcomes. Results: Among the 94 cases, 12.8% were WNT-AG, 54.3% were sonic hedgehog-activated subgroup (SHH-AG), and 33.0% were Groups 3 and 4 (G3/4). nLEF1 demonstrated higher specificity and sensitivity for WNT-AG than \u03b2-catenin, identifying it as a more reliable diagnostic marker. High pLEF1 expression was strongly associated with SHH-AG. Cyclin D1 positivity was predominantly observed in WNT-AG. While ROR2 did not identify WNT-AG effectively, its absence in Group 3 cases was notable. Prognostic analysis revealed that LEF1 expression patterns correlated with favorable survival outcomes: total LEF1 (tLEF1) and nLEF1 were associated with improved overall survival, whereas pLEF1 and tLEF1 were linked to better progression-free survival. Conclusion: Nuclear LEF1 (nLEF1) is at least as effective as \u03b2-Catenin in identifying WNT-AG and may serve as a superior diagnostic marker. Cyclin D1 can be used as a complementary marker in WNT-AG detection. ROR2 negativity may indicate G3 tumors, though further studies are warranted to confirm its prognostic value.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major cause of graft dysfunction and failure, driving inflammation and tissue damage. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess therapeutic potential due to their immunomodulatory properties. Notably, neutrophils express the inhibitory receptor CD32b, which is a specific target of the immunosuppressive molecule soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 (sFgl2). Aims: This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms of genetically engineered MSCs expressing sFgl2 (sFgl2-MSCs) in treating renal I/R injury, with a focus on neutrophil regulation. Study Design: An in vivo renal I/R injury mouse model. Methods: Following imaging to localize MSCs, mice were randomly allocated into four treatment groups. Treatments were administered according to group assignments. Renal function was assessed using serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, while systemic inflammation was evaluated by measuring serum interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and IL-10 via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Neutrophil proportions in the blood and kidney were analyzed by flow cytometry. At 24 h, surface expression of CD95 and CD206 was assessed; CD206 was used to define neutrophils with N2-like (CD206+) and N1-like (CD95+) phenotypic features. Histopathological scoring of renal tissue was performed at 24 h. Infiltration of Ly6G+ neutrophils and citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) as well as myeloperoxidase/CitH3 co-localization (an indicator of neutrophil extracellular traps, NETs) were detected by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Circulating free DNA (cf-DNA) in plasma was quantified using PicoGreen dye. Furthermore, the impact of sFgl2-MSCs on bone marrow-derived neutrophil polarization and function was evaluated in vitro using flow cytometry, ELISA, and a co-culture system. Results: While unmodified MSCs exhibited a moderate therapeutic effect, sFgl2-MSCs treatment was significantly more effective. sFgl2-MSCs markedly improved renal function, reduced histopathological damage (e.g., tubular necrosis), and modulated systemic cytokine levels by decreasing pro-inflammatory (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1) and increasing anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines. Crucially, sFgl2-MSCs regulated neutrophil responses in the kidney: they increased the proportion of N2-like neutrophils and decreased N1-like neutrophils, concurrently reducing NET-related markers, as evidenced by decreased CitH3 and cf-DNA. Mechanistically, sFgl2-MSCs enhanced neutrophil immunoregulatory function via the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 signaling pathway. Conclusion: Genetically modified sFgl2-MSCs alleviate renal I/R injury. This protective effect is associated with engagement of neutrophil CD32b receptors, activation of the TGF\u03b2-Smad2/3 pathway, promotion of a protective N2-like neutrophil phenotype, and suppression of N1-like and NET-related markers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background: Aberrations in cadherin-related 23 (CDH23) account for a significant proportion of familial autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB12), a common subtype of hereditary hearing loss worldwide. Aims: This study aimed to elucidate the molecular basis and pathogenic mechanism of DFNB12 in an affected girl from a nine-member pedigree. Study Design: Family-based genetic study with pedigree analysis. Methods: Clinical whole-exome sequencing combined with pedigree analysis was used to identify disease-causing mutations. The potential functional consequences of these mutations were investigated using structural bioinformatic approaches, including homology modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and other relevant tools. Results: The proband carried compound heterozygous variants: a known pathogenic maternal variant (c.6049G > A) and a paternal haplotype comprising two linked variants (c.3262G > A and c.6911G > A), each individually classified as benign. Pedigree segregation analysis demonstrated that the paternal haplotype acts as a single pathogenic allele. Conclusion: Two individually benign variants can combine to form a novel pathogenic haplotype (c.3262A\u2013c.6911A). This mechanism may be under-recognized in routine variant interpretation pipelines. Our findings underscore the importance of evaluating the combined effects of linked benign variants to ensure accurate genetic counseling.",
